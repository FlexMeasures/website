                <p>Version v0.11 of FlexMeasures adds much more useful data views, which are also customisable.</p>
<p>In addition, we completed the Docker-compose stack to include background job workers. This is very useful for developers.</p>
<p><a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-11-0-august-28-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See changelog</a> or read on below to read what we added.</p>
<h2>Data views</h2>
<p>FlexMeasures is about optimising how your flexible assets are run. It's thus crucial to show the data in context. For instance, the charging schedule of an electric car should be shown together with what it's optimised against. In a project of ours, that is dynamic (hourly) prices. The asset page for the EV should show the prices, as well. The featured image of this blog entry shows this.</p>
<p>Also, we believe users want to concentrate on the data, therefore we moved the controls (date-picker, editing of asset attributes) out of the way.</p>
<figure ><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/26/asset-page-011.gif" alt="A Gif showing the new asset page and the edit controls." width="750" height="359"></figure>
<figcaption >An example of the new asset page and its controls which are only visible if needed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are numerous other additions for better data viewing, like better axis, tooltip and unit support in plots, remembering the selected date range across pages and  the dashboard being able to group assets by accounts (not just type).</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests  <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">449</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/467" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">467</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">423</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">446</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">447</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">474</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">475</a>.</p>
<h2>Full docker compose stack</h2>
<p>You could tell from the last releases that we want to Dockerize FlexMeasures, so it becomes a first-class cloud citizen, but also that developers can get it to run locally with the least installation hassle.</p>
<p>The missing piece was that the Docker compose stack now also spins up a Redis database and a worker node for doing computations in a queue.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/docker-compose.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker-compose tutorial</a> reflects this now.</p>
<p>This work was done in <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pull Request 455</a>.</p>
<h2>Serving data in the resolution you need</h2>
<p>When getting data out of FlexMeasures, you also might want a specific resolution. Hourly data is much lighter (if that is all you need) than 5-minute data, for instance. </p>
<p>We added a resolution parameter to <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/v3_0.html#get--api-v3_0-sensors-data">the <code class="notranslate">/sensors/data</code> (GET) endpoint.</a></p>

<h2 id="mcetoc_1g2pacnrh8">What does FlexMeasures do?</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>FlexMeasures is an energy management system (EMS), but a specialized one. You can see it as a data-driven decision-support system for energy flexibility.</div>
<div>The question FlexMeasures helps to solves is: What are the best times to run my flexible assets? For instance, when to (dis)charge my EV batteries? When should we run our heat pumps to warm up the office?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here is the simple version ― sensor data goes in, optimized schedules come out:</div>
<h2><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/simple-flexEMS-2.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/responsive/simple-flexEMS-2-xs.png 300w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/responsive/simple-flexEMS-2-sm.png 480w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/responsive/simple-flexEMS-2-md.png 768w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/responsive/simple-flexEMS-2-lg.png 1024w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/responsive/simple-flexEMS-2-xl.png 1360w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/responsive/simple-flexEMS-2-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="750" height="191"></figure>Why do you do this?</h2>
<div> </div>
<div>See <a href="https://www.seita.nl/why" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this mission statement</a> (from the original creators): We have to go green. Flexible demand has to be matched with green energy. Open innovation can get us to the speed we need for the global transition.</div>
<h2>How does FlexMeasures add value?</h2>
<div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the end, energy flexibility is about saving energy costs and CO₂. This is why we do this in the first place.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Taking a more closer look, we believe that lowering the cost of software development can help a big deal. More organisations will be willing to make use of energy flexibility, if the initial costs of such smart systems are low enough. And software development (not even the machine learning parts) makes up a bigger part of the costs than people realize.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We want developers to love building novel apps and services with FlexMeasures, and for them to focus on the context-specific dimensions: The configuration of how they want FlexMeasures to optimize outcomes, and how this gets presented to users/operators.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Let's take a closer look at FlexMeasures' three core value drivers:</span>
<div><br>
<div>1. Real-time data intelligence and integration, with advice for the rest of the day. For example, forecasts and schedules are made available via API.</div>
<div>2. Energy sensor and environment data have multiple sources and their forecasts are uncertain. FlexMeasures uses <a href="https://github.com/SeitaBV/timely-beliefs)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the timely-beliefs library</a> to model this well.</div>
<div>3. Developer support ― building customer-facing apps &amp; services is where energy flexibility hits the road. FlexMeasures reduces developer workload with a well-documented API, data visualization and multi-tenancy, and it supports plugins to customize and extend the platform to your needs.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here is a more complete picture of how FlexMeasures fits into an advanced and configurable data-schedules loop:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/overview-flexEMS.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/responsive/overview-flexEMS-xs.png 300w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/responsive/overview-flexEMS-sm.png 480w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/responsive/overview-flexEMS-md.png 768w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/responsive/overview-flexEMS-lg.png 1024w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/responsive/overview-flexEMS-xl.png 1360w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/responsive/overview-flexEMS-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" width="800" height="457"></figure></div>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1g2pagetfj">Why is FlexMeasures open source, and why is it part of the Linux Energy Foundation?</h2>
<p>We saw two reasons to open source the code of FlexMeasures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nowadays, open source is a great fit for the speed of innovation which we need, and also the spread of innovation. The energy transition has to go blazingly fast, everywhere. These days, open source projects are often able to innovate faster than closed source counterparts (once they've picked up momentum).</li>
<li>From our many years of experience in designing smart energy solutions, we've come to realize that energy solutions often have multiple stakeholders (e.g. asset owner, user, network operator, energy service company). The transparency offered by open source, and the lack of lock-in, makes collaboration easier and agreements faster.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="https://www.lfenergy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux Energy Foundation</a> is a great place for the FlexMeasures project to be part of the growing community of people who understand the above reasoning.open source </p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1g2pagetfk">How do I use FlexMeasures / get started?</h2>
<p>We make FlexMeasures, so that developers are as productive with energy optimization as possible. As we are developers ourselves, we know that it takes a couple smaller steps to engage with new technology.</p>
<p>Your journey, from dipping your toes in the water towards being a happy FlexMeasures power user, could look like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>
<p>Quickstart ― Find an optimized schedule for your flexible asset, like a battery, with standard FlexMeasures tooling. This is basically what the from-scratch tutorial above does. All you need are 10 minutes and a CSV file with prices to optimise against.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automate ― get the prices from an open API, for instance <a class="reference external" href="https://transparency.entsoe.eu/">ENTSO-E</a> (using a plugin like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-entsoe">flexmeasures-entsoe</a>), and run the scheduler regularly in a cron job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integrate ― Load the schedules via FlexMeasures’ API, so you can directly control your assets and/or show them within your own front-end.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customize ― Load other data (e.g. your solar production or weather forecasts via <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-openweathermap/">flexmeasures-openweathermap</a>. Adapt the algorithms, e.g. do your own forecasting or tweak the standard scheduling algorithm so it optimizes what you care about. Or write a plugin for accessing a new kind of market. The opportunities are endless!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1g2pagetfl">Can you give some real-world examples where FlexMeasures is used today?</h2>
<p>FlexMeasures is being used in a few industry projects (water sanitation, sludge burning), where we for instance help to run centrifuges to run during the greenest hours of the day.</p>
<p>It is also used in projects with smaller assets, around the smart home setting (<a href="https://positive-design.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a vehicle-to-grid living lab</a> and battery optimization). Here, FlexMeasures helps to buy cheap, and sell at high prices, for an optimal financial result.</p>
<p>Much work currently goes into the integration of heat pumps.</p>
<p>Of course, we might be missing some use cases. <a href="https://flexmeasures.io/get-in-touch/">We'd love to hear from you</a>.</p>
<h2 id="mcetoc_1g2pagetfm">How can FlexMeasures become a puzzle piece in large-scale solutions?</h2>
<p>The "data-driven" part is where we start! From our experience, data pipelines and dashboarding around energy-consuming assets now often exists.</p>
<p>FlexMeasures works well as the single EMS, but also as an added smart back-end. Integrating the data often means to feed only the relevant parts to FlexMeasures (only relevant sensors, only the resolution needed for decision-making in schedules, e.g. 5 minutes).</p>
<p>Once the right algorithms are connected, FlexMeasures provides optimized schedules via API. Its UI also shows sensor data and schedules and provides the ability for users/operators to annotate them.</p>
<p>The schedules an thus be integrated into larger solutions, into user-facing apps etc. Just as the context requires.</p>

                    <img src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/23/horizontal-logo-monochromatic-white.webp" alt="Docker logo" />
                <p>Version v0.10 of FlexMeasures (<a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-10-0-may-8-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see changelog</a>) adds the ability to run Flexmeasures inside a Docker container. Containerization is a big step towards easier installation and scaling in the cloud!</p>
<p>We also gave the backoffice a nice styling update.</p>
<h2>Dockerization</h2>
<p>Docker is great for developer productivity and for running APIs in modern scalable clouds environments. We created <a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lfenergy/flexmeasures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Docker image for FlexMeasures</a>, so from now on, it's possible to run FlexMeasures in a Docker container.</p>
<p>The great advantage is that running FM can happen on every computer or cloud server within minutes. We also offer a docker compose file. Check out the documentation (<a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/host/docker.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker</a>, <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/docker-compose.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docker compose</a>). We also updated <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tut/toy-example-from-scratch.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our main entry-level tutorial</a> with getting started using Docker.</p>
<p>A nice part of the work that was done in the docker-compose part is that the FlexMeasures API now has a health endpoint, which tells us if FlexMeasures is ready to work on requests. Next to containerization, this is the type of preparation one needs to run a software inside Kubernetes :)</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">416</a>.</p>
<h2>New Style</h2>
<p>With the FlexMeasures EMS, we believe in the API as a first-level citizen. But FM also shows you your assets and data out of the box, and the web design was in need of some love.</p>

                <p>Version v0.9.0 of FlexMeasures (<a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-9-0-march-8-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see changelog</a>) adds many CLI commands to control FlexMeasures' data from the terminal. We hope this helps with reducing the onboarding time for new accounts!</p>
<p>FlexMeasures will also now convert incoming data, if it has a different source unit than the required sensor unit.</p>
<p>Finally, we added new tutorial on how to get started using FlexMeasures in just a few minutes and we began a new API version (v3) which is more REST-like than v2 and better supports <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/note-on-datamodel-transition.html">the new data model. </a>  Do let us know if these things help you be more productive with FlexMeasures!</p>
<h2>CLI commands</h2>
<p>Developers like to work from the terminal. This lets them interact quicker and more direct with a software platform. With the 0.9.0 release, FlexMeasures adds several commands to work with an instance.</p>
<p>To have them available is especially useful when onboarding a new account or new assets (which is the time when the most developer attention is spent in a FlexMeasures project, or any enterprise software project). These commands are also useful to automate tasks like data ingestion or scheduling.</p>
<p>Here is  a list of new commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>Showing data: <code>flexmeasures show accounts</code>, <code>flexmeasures show account</code>, <code>flexmeasures show roles</code>, <code>flexmeasures show asset-types</code>, <code>flexmeasures show asset</code>, <code>flexmeasures show data-sources</code>, and <code>flexmeasures show beliefs</code></li>
<li>Resample sensor data to a different resolution: <code>flexmeasures db-ops resample-data</code></li>
<li>Create a new schedule for a given power sensor: <code>flexmeasures add schedule</code></li>
<li>Edit/add an attribute on an asset or sensor: <code>flexmeasures edit attribute</code></li>
<li>Add a toy account with a battery and a market for trying FlexMeasures out quickly: <code>flexmeasures add toy-account</code></li>
<li>Deleting data: <code> flexmeasures delete unchanged-beliefs</code>, <code>flexmeasures delete nan-beliefs</code>, <code>flexmeasures delete sensor</code>, <code>flexmeasures delete asset</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can see all commands in <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/commands.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlexMeasures' CLI documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Unit conversion</h2>
<p>Units are a crucial topic in time series data. Only if you get them right, will your data also be correct (and you avoid the risk of incorrect data / lengthy debugging periods). Especially if you have to transform data. One example is of course power to energy, e.g. kW to kWh. There is many more examples.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/rounding.png" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="XKCD on unit conversion" width="420" height="489">
<figcaption >The relevant XKCD cartoon</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We use the excellent <a href="https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pint library</a> to help us with that. With version 0.9.0,  FlexMeasures will now convert incoming data, if it has a different source unit than the required sensor unit.</p>
<p>For instance, if the incoming data is kWh, and we know the sensor should store kW, and we also know the sensor's time resolution (e.g. it sends data once per 5 minutes), then we can store kWh data correctly as kW data.</p>
<p>Another great example are percentages. We might receive data in percentages, but it should be permille.</p>
<p>This is now done automatically in both the CLI (<code>flexmeasures add beliefs</code>) and the API (<code>POST /sensorData</code>) when adding data.</p>

<h2>Toy tutorial</h2>
<p>We want many organisations to use FlexMeasures and drastically reduce the development time they need to get an energy flexibility app or service up and running. For this, we were missing a tutorial to show from scratch how FlexMeasures can be useful within minutes.</p>
<p>We now have one where you install FlexMeasures and within a couple minutes you are optimizing the charging schedule of a battery. See it in action here.</p>

            <![CDATA[
                <p>You can extend the FlexMeasures EMS with functionality like UI pages, API endpoints,  CLI functions and <a href="https://flexmeasures.io/roadmap/">eventually</a> algorithms. This is actually how energy flexibility apps &amp; services are built on top of FlexMeasures!</p>
<p>Extensibility is key to the open innovation we are going for here.  Read <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/plugins.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> how one builds a plugin. </p>
<p>Solving a use case for a client often involves putting custom code for them in a plugin. So at Seita, we've made quite a few which are private.</p>
<p>Here, let's list crucially useful and also open-source plugins which actually exist already ― this list should grow (<a href="https://www.seita.nl/contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tell us</a> if there is one you made and want to add here):</p>
<h3>OpenWeatherMap</h3>
<p><a href="https://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenWeatherMap</a> is one of the best services to get your weather forecasts these days. And these forecasts might be highly useful for deciding what the optimal schedule for the next few hours is. For instance, to maximise self-consumption of your solar panels.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/OpenWeather-Logo.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/OpenWeather-Logo-xs.jpg 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/OpenWeather-Logo-sm.jpg 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/OpenWeather-Logo-md.jpg 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/OpenWeather-Logo-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/OpenWeather-Logo-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/OpenWeather-Logo-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="OpenWeatherMap  Logo" width="432" height="149"></figure>
<p>The source code of the plugin is <a href="https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-openweathermap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. It adds two CLI commands, one for registering weather sensors on desired locations, one for calling the API and gathering the forecasts for the upcoming hours.</p>
<h3>ENTSO-E</h3>
<p>Market data is crucial for planning ahead. Two examples we use are day-ahead prices (to optimize energy costs) and production forecasts (to estimate the CO2 content on the grid for the upcoming hours).</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/ENTSO-E_logo_sml.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/ENTSO-E_logo_sml-xs.jpg 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/ENTSO-E_logo_sml-sm.jpg 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/ENTSO-E_logo_sml-md.jpg 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/ENTSO-E_logo_sml-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/ENTSO-E_logo_sml-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/ENTSO-E_logo_sml-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="ENTSO-E logo" width="443" height="120"></figure>
<p>ENTSO-E is the association of European TSOs. <a href="https://transparency.entsoe.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Their transparency platform</a> publishes different kind of data across European regions. </p>
<p>The source code of the plugin is <a href="https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-entsoe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. It currently supports importing day-ahead prices as well as generation. Based on generation, the CO2 content for the upcoming day can be computed.</p>
<h3>Z-Info</h3>
<p>A plugin for importing data from <a href="https://www.z-info.nl" rel="nofollow">Z-Info</a> into FlexMeasures. Z-Info is a sensor data service for the Dutch water industry. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-zinfo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300.png" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="Z-Info Logo" width="188" height="300"></figure>

                    <img src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/20/salman-hossain-saif-n6uLxWeCMao-unsplash.jpg" alt="AA batteries on wooden background, by Salman Hossain Saif" />
                <p>Version v0.8.0 of FlexMeasures (<a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-8-0-january-24-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see changelog</a>) improves scheduling &amp; helps to keep data safe. Behind the scenes, a big data model transition is taking form.</p>
<h2>Better scheduling</h2>
<p>We work with scheduling of batteries<a href="https://seita.nl/project/v2ghome-living-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> in practice</a>, which is a great opportunity to find small and crucial improvements.</p>
<p>For instance, we were able to improve the stability in edge cases. FlexMeasures also now can take into account the limited round trip efficiency of batteries, as well as asymmetric buy/sell prices.</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/291">291</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/267">267</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/270">270</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/300">300</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/291">291</a>.</p>
<h2>Safer data</h2>
<p>If several accounts (customers) sit in the same FlexMeasures server, it is all the more crucial that only the correctly authorized persons get to see or change data.</p>
<p>v0.8.0 introduces the ability to protect data within users within one account, building on our multi-tenancy model from <a href="https://flexmeasures.io/v060-multi-tenancy-error-monitoring/">version 0.6.0</a>. This work was done in <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/210">Pull Request 210</a>.</p>
<p>When implementing authorization, it's highly important to do that in a developer-friendly way. What we mean with that is developers need to find it straightforward to make the correct decisions of who has permission to create/read/update/delete which data, and which API endpoints require the user to have which permissions.</p>
<p>In v0.8.0, we implement an authorization model, where the first question is answered in one central place (on the data model) and with high granularity (object-level security). We also offer a new API endpoint decorator (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">@permission_required_for_context</span></code>), so in-built endpoints, as well as API endpoints in plugins, can be protected easily.</p>
<p>This work was done in <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/234">Pull Request 234</a>.</p>
<h2>Data model transition</h2>
<p>Behind the curtains, this version makes a huge step from our deprecated data model to a new, more flexible one. We describe this transition in detail <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/note-on-datamodel-transition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, even with before &amp; after pictures.</p>
<p>We are left with a few items on our TODO list, but in this version, we made a big effort. We moved a lot of structure over, as well as actual data and some UI (dashboard, assets). We believe that was the hardest part.</p>
<p>We also took care so existing users feel as little blockage as possible. We wrote extra code so the old data model can still function in the new world, and that data is copied over in the background (don't forget to do the database migration, of course, see changelog).</p>

            <![CDATA[
                    <img src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/19/plugin-fender.png" alt="" />
                <p>Version v0.7.0 of FlexMeasures (<a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-7-0-october-26-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see changelog</a>) puts emphasis on plugins that are ready for actual productive use. Professional packaging, testing &amp; style! </p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/plugins.html">FlexMeasures plugins</a> are a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hugely</span> important concept. Writing data integrations for,  and <a href="https://seita.nl/services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">services</a> on top of FlexMeasures ― that's done with plugins.  To support getting started with them in the right way, we now provide <a href="https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-plugin-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a CookieCutter template</a> to get you started in 30 seconds. It also includes a few Blueprint examples and best practices like tests.</p>
<h2>Python packages</h2>
<p>Plugins can be complete Python packages now. Python code which can be installed on your system, e.g. with the pip package manager. You could even upload it to the Pypi index :)</p>
<p>So what is professional about packages? It is more straightforward with a package to add code hygiene, version management and dependencies. You can imagine how much better you'll manage when your plugin can depend on a specific FlexMeasures version and other plugins can depend on yours.</p>
<p>We envision that a top-level service plugin lists FlexMeasures, as well as one or two data integration plugins. You could install that plugin, and immediately run FlexMeasures and your service runs,</p>
<p>If you use the packaging option, FlexMeasures still wants you to define the Blueprints for UI, CLI or API functionality at the top-level of the plugin. (If your plugin is just a folder with files, it still should be in the __init__.py file).</p>
<p>To hit the ground running with the packaging approach,  try the CookieCutter template we mention above, where we give you a full package structure.</p>
<p>This work was done in <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/182">Pull Request 182</a>.</p>
<h2>Test automation support</h2>
<p>If the plugin is used for serious stuff, its code also should be tested in automated fashion.</p>
<p>Some tests test an integration of the behavior on top of an actual running app. That's of course a FlexMeasures app. So the plugin tests need to tell FlexMeasures to load the plugin. <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/plugins.html#notes-on-writing-tests-for-your-plugin">This is now possible</a> easily.</p>
<p>This work was done in <a href="http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/220">Pull Request 220</a>.</p>
<h2>Style your plugin</h2>
<p>We believe that FlexMeasures shines as a backend, with a modern one-page JavaScript/HTML frontend for user-facing apps built on top of it.  That's why we provide a full API.</p>
<p>However, a real quick way to provide a UI is to use the Jinja2 templating capabilities of  Flask (which FlexMeasures is built on). We do that in pilots when no frontend dev is available.</p>
<p>Now we made it easier to impose your style on this UI. It's now possible to <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/plugins.html#adding-your-own-stylesheets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add your custom CSS spreadsheet</a> and <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/plugins.html#using-a-custom-favicon-icon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also show your own logo</a> for the top left corner. It made our ESCo customer happy to see their colors, font and logo in our pilot service's UI when we met their client :)</p>

                <p>The roadmap for further development of the FlexMeasures EMS is the wishlist of its stakeholders.</p>
<p>Are you a stakeholder? Then <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-in-touch.html">talk to us</a> to influence these plans.</p>
<p><strong>[Q1 2023]</strong> More powerful algorithm configurations, to support more use cases and more custom situations (e.g. research). For <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scheduling</a>, as well as for <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forecasting</a>. [work has started in Q4 2022]</p>
<p><strong>[Q2 2023]</strong> Allow for <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/15" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">annotations on time series</a>, e.g. to model processes and operator feedback. [work has started in 2022]</p>
<p><strong>[Q2 2023] </strong>KPIs support (e.g. daily totals), customizable</p>
<p><strong>[Q3 2023] </strong>Scheduling algorithm for heat buffering</p>
<p><strong>[Q4 2023]</strong>  Build out the flexibility modelling, by supporting Fraunhofers Energy Flexibility Data Model (<a href="http://publica.fraunhofer.de/starweb/servlet.starweb?path=epub.web&amp;search=N-642370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EDFM</a>) and TNO's S2</p>
<p><strong>[tbd]</strong> Authorization model for <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allowing "super-accounts" to manage other accounts</a> (e.g. for ESCos) or add data to them (e.g. meter data companies).</p>
<p><strong>[tbd]</strong> <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smarter monitoring</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[tbd]</strong> Scheduler compatible with <a href="https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/shapeshifter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ShapeShifter</a> (based on USEF flex trading protocol)</p>
<p><strong>[tbd]</strong> Better plotting support (via API/vega-lite), for plugins to define their own plots which are then made available in the FlexMeasures API (usable in custom frontends).</p>
<p><strong>[tbd] </strong>Better tooling to work well at scale (e.g. support load balancing, db sharding etc). Also using Docker to scale up more flexibly (e.g. in Kubernetes).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Historic achievements</h3>
<p><strong>[Q4 2022]</strong> <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/9">Custom scheduling algorithms</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[Q4 2022]</strong> <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/10">Better data views</a> for sensor and assets. </p>
<p><strong>[Q2 2022]</strong> <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dockerization</a> – allow to start a FlexMeasures node quickly without local installation (and deploy in cloud environments).</p>
<p><strong>[Q1 2022]</strong> Improve developer experience (<a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLI commands</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">out-of-the-box tutorial</a>) </p>
<p><strong>[Q1 2022]</strong> Data model migration to support all kind of sensors (more than power, weather &amp; prices), as well as units.</p>
<p><strong>[Q3 2021]</strong> Support for <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/158">multi-tenancy.</a></p>
<p><strong>[Q2 2021]</strong> Allow developers to write custom logic and styles in <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plugins</a>.</p>
<p><strong>[Q2 2021]</strong> <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public release</a>.</p>
