<p>Version v0.26 of FlexMeasures makes the scheduler more flexible for edge situations (in which the target might be just out of reach, or not all targets can be satisfied). This is an important step in scheduling that behaves according to the priorities of each site.</p>
<p>Also, the UI for showing assets got an important update - we split the overloaded asset page into several pages. This improves browsing and loading times.</p>
<p><a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/latest/changelog.html#v0-26-0-june-03-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the changelog</a> for a complete list of improvements (50 PRs!).</p>
<p>Let's dive int the two main features!</p>
</div>
<div class="post__inner post__entry">
<h2>Relaxed scheduling</h2>
<p>You can tell FlexMeasures to find an optimal schedule within a list of contraints (e.g. grid constraints, minimum fill level of EV batteries etc.). Sometimes the perfect solution does not exist. FlexMeasures should still present a schedule that is the best it can do. But which goal/constraint is most important? We are working on letting the user decide.</p>
<p>Let us consider a simple example: In the V2G Liberty project (which uses FlexMeasures as a scheduling backend), the user can give a minimal charge level, for when they plan longer trips. FlexMeasure should attempt to reach this target, but sometimes the user might have given FlexMeasures too little time to accomplish that.</p>
<p>Here is a visualization:</p>
<figure ><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/V2GLiberty-Screenshot.png" alt="" width="700" height="549" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<figcaption >The V2GLiberty app, showing FlexMeasures' schedule (orange) and the minimal-charge window (blue)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here, the minimal charge window cannot be reached, but FlexMeasures will reach the minimal level as early as possible. In earlier version of the FlexMeasures scheduler, it might have told you that no valid solution exists. But of course, here the user wants it to try.</p>
<p>If there are multiple competing goals/constraints, it becomes a matter of priority. In FlexMeasures, penalties can now be set for any breaches of these goals/constrains, which is a way for the system operator to determine which of them matters more than others.</p>
<div class="message-body normal-message-body" data-v-62a2ac48="">
<div class="message-main" data-v-f2ec36a0="" data-v-62a2ac48="">
<div class="message-main__text markdown-message" data-v-f2ec36a0="">
<div class="rich-text--wrapper rich-text--wrapper-markdown" dir="auto" data-v-1de82f09="" data-v-f2ec36a0="">
<div data-v-1de82f09="">
<div data-v-1de82f09="">
<p data-v-1de82f09="">We have 3 types of relaxations (each in two directions) whose prices can all be set in the flex-context and flex-model:</p>
<ul data-v-1de82f09="">
<li data-v-1de82f09="">site-consumption-capacity / site-production-capacity</li>
<li data-v-1de82f09="">soc-minima / soc-maxima (for each device)</li>
<li data-v-1de82f09="">consumption-capacity / production-capacity (for each device)</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, there is a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site-consumption-breach-price</span></code> attribute in the flex-context, where you could tell FlexMeasures that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site-consumption-capacity</span></code> is a soft constraint, but how important it is to you. You could set it to 1000 EUR/MW (if your optimization problem uses EUR as target). You could think of the setting as a (contractual) penalty. The setting can even be a sensor, so the penalties can vary over the time of day!</p>

<p>This work (most of it) was done in Pull Requests <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1300</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 1405</a>.</p>
<h2>Cleaner asset pages - and a bonus</h2>
<p>The asset is our central data type. They have sensors, or even sub-assets ― they are the building blocks of site structures in FlexMeasures. Until now, FlexMeasures had one asset page in the UI, where the user could:</p>
<ul>
<li>look at (and edit) graphs</li>
<li>edit asset properties</li>
<li>see the asset connectivity status</li>
<li>see the audit log</li>
</ul>
<p>Recently, we added the capability to edit the flex context. It became a bit much, and the page also tool longer to load.</p>
<p>We separated the page into dedicated pages, for easier and faster navigation, and we added a context view, for when an asset hierarchy is build to model a site:</p>

<p>Also nice: users can select their favorite asset page, so when they visit the asset, they always see that view first (per default it is the context page).</p>

<p>Version v0.25 of FlexMeasures supports editing the flex-context on an asset (instead of sending it each time a schedule is triggered). This can improve interactions for developers, but also service desk personnel! Also, we improved the status page.</p>

<p>Let's dive int the two main features!</p>
</div>
<div class="post__inner post__entry">
<h2>Fully editable flex context</h2>
<p>Behind-the-meter orchestration can become a complex problem, with multiple optimization goals potentially competing. We talked about this in <a href="https://flexmeasures.io/024-more-expressive-congestion-modeling-data-dashboards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the blog post about the 0.24 release</a>, as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/stable/features/scheduling.html#the-flex-context">The flex-context</a> is very important way to describe contraints and optimization goals (and is accompanied by <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/stable/features/scheduling.html#the-flex-models-corresponding-schedulers">the flex-model</a>).</p>
<figure ><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/screenshot-asset-editflexcontext.png" alt="Editing the flex context in the new modal dialogue" width="800" height="652" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/screenshot-asset-editflexcontext-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/screenshot-asset-editflexcontext-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/screenshot-asset-editflexcontext-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/screenshot-asset-editflexcontext-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/screenshot-asset-editflexcontext-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/screenshot-asset-editflexcontext-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<figcaption >Editing the flex context in the new dialogue</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We extended the flex-model and now it is time to make it possible to add it to the data model. The current only way to specify this information is with every call to API or CLI when requesting FlexMeasures to compute a new schedule.</p>
<p>For developers, this might make it easier (less work on coding requests), but also this opens possibilities for maintaining this information by somebody else than developers. Maybe service personnel can now update these fields (which will be logged in the audit log :), or installers do that by themselves?</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1293</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1320</a>, and several smaller follow-ups..</p>
<h2>Nicer status page</h2>
<p>The status page is also a feature meant to increase the serviceability of FlexMeasures. You can see when the latest data entries for sensors came in, what jobs (scheduling, forecasting) happend recently and if they failed.</p>
<p>However, the page could be more useful. The first iteration on this since more than six months cleans the page visually, and separates the rows per data source types.</p>
<p>Forecasts and schedules for a power sensor are about the future, after all, while the measurements are about the past. Obviously, the traffic light needs to reflect what kind of source the data comes from - we expect forecasts to always be available into the future, while measurements (which are used in forecasts and schedules) are not, but should also not be too old.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/asset-status-source-type.png" alt="Status page, now differentiated by data source type" width="800" height="467" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/asset-status-source-type-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/asset-status-source-type-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/asset-status-source-type-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/asset-status-source-type-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/asset-status-source-type-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/asset-status-source-type-2xl.png 1600w">
<figcaption >Status page, now differentiated by data source type</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next work on the status page will address its speed, which still seems underwhelming if there is much data, and enable to select which sensors should be shown.</p>

                <p>The energy sector is undergoing a major transformation, with new challenges and opportunities arising from the rise of renewable energy sources and the electrification of everything from heating to transportation. One of the most pressing challenges is managing the increasing demand for electricity while ensuring grid stability and minimizing costs. Additionally, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power makes it difficult to match supply with demand, leading to potential grid imbalances.</p>
<p>Energy flexibility is a solution to these challenges. It refers to the ability to adjust energy consumption and production in response to changes in supply, demand, or prices. This can be achieved through a variety of technologies and strategies, such as smart appliances, energy storage systems, and demand response programs.</p>
<p>FlexMeasures is an open source EMS platform for optimizing energy flexibility, built for innovative startups and digitally-enabled energy service companies (ESCOs).</p>
<p>Think of it as the “Lego Mindstorms” of smart energy planning – combining out-of-the-box functionality (like the algorithms but also UIs and APIs) with modularity, so your digital energy service has the ability for smart orchestration of behind-the-meter assets.</p>
<p>Developed by<a href="https://seita.nl/"> Seita Energy Flexibility</a>, a Dutch-German startup and contributed to <a href="https://lfenergy.org/">LF Energy</a>, FlexMeasures is already being adopted by smart energy startups worldwide. These startups are leveraging its versatile, developer-friendly tools to build impactful solutions for energy planning and optimization, often using FlexMeasures as the basis for their EMS design.</p>
<p><strong>The Opportunity of Energy Flexibility</strong></p>
<p>A device is energy-flexible when its consumption can be shifted in time. For example, charging an EV later or creating heat ahead of time to take advantage of lower prices, lower CO2 emissions, or peak demand avoidance. These goals are valuable to asset owners and utilities. The behind-the-meter segment is growing rapidly, and grid congestion and market price volatility are also increasing.</p>
<p>FlexMeasures can help orchestrate a wide range of use cases, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domestic buildings with heat pumps and EVs, optimized to lower energy costs under a dynamic tariff</li>
<li>Neighborhoods with shared facilities and grid capacity constraints</li>
<li>Office buildings with multiple EVs</li>
<li>SME buildings with light industrial processes and solar roofs</li>
<li>Large industrial plants with heat buffering systems</li>
</ul>
<figure class="wp-image-10812 size-full aligncenter"><i><img loading="lazy"  src="https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-1.png" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" srcset="https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-1.png 642w, https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-1-300x169.png 300w" alt="" width="642" height="362" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></i></p>
<p><i>Figure 1: Behind-the-meter orchestration, as imagined by AI</i></p>
<p>Now there are startups in smart charging and smart heating popping up, all of them re-inventing the smart orchestrating part, which essentially boils down to that energy flexibility problem: When should which device do what it needs to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>      Why not re-use a common and open technology for this smart scheduling, even share in developing it, making room for these startups to focus on their customer-facing value-add? Startups and ESCOs could save drastically on theirR&amp;D and engineering costs, as a complex aspect is now easier. It’s important to note that the orchestration challenge behind the meter structurally does not differ very much across the world. Electrification of transport (e-SUVs or e-scooters) and temperature regulation (heating or cooling) happens everywhere, and so does the stress this causes on electricity grids.</li>
<li>      Talking about complexity, if you recall the use cases above, it is obvious that owners aim to optimize all devices together, orchestrating them as one. They only have one energy contract, after all. Smart charging and smart heating/cooling combined (also called “sector coupling”), adding a battery to the mix, adding dynamic tariffs and congestion limits. This orchestration problem is more complex than many startups realize at first.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the customer is different per startup or ESCO, and per region. They should concentrate on designing this “last mile” towards local culture, customer expectations and conditions of hardware and markets. This leads to a unique UX, custom device integrations and so on. In principle, the logic of orchestrating devices can be served by the same smart back-end. Why not use an open source one?</p>

<p><strong>FlexMeasures in Action</strong></p>
<p>Here are two testimonials of startups that have implemented FlexMeasures to use smart orchestration in their own innovative energy services:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Thiink Inc (U.S.)</span><br>“FlexMeasures is a great way to start creating an energy management system solution. You can easily simulate and test without having all the energy hardware. The built-in UI makes it easy to visualize what is going on. Using the terminology of the USEF framework is also good and helps people acquire a terminology that helps with understanding of the European energy markets.”<br>— Ragnar Edholm (Senior Vice President of Engineering), <a href="https://thiink.com/">Thiink Inc</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iRasus Technologies (India)</span><br>“In India, we currently see three use cases for battery energy storage systems (BESS): round-the-clock solar power, islanding and frequency regulation in a grid, and diesel generator replacement. We aim to use FlexMeasures for the steering logic that will connect the monitoring and the control. For this logic, price-based scheduling and forecasting as an ancillary feature are important to us. In India, any optimisation tool needs to be better than a guy with a full-time job trying to do the same using Excel, because India has loads of such people at affordable salaries for employers. What’s exciting here is the option to have interoperability and customisation. And that’s where FlexMeasures can fit in.”<br>— Aniruth Ramesh (CTO), <a href="https://irasus.com/">iRasus Technologies</a></p>
<p><strong>FlexMeasures Features</strong></p>
<p>FlexMeasures not only plans energy flows, it also supports building of web-apps. It starts as a basis for building your smart energy services, then helps you extend with custom features and finally supports scaling up. Here is a high-level list of features:</p>
<ul>
<li>    Cloud Energy Management System (API-first)</li>
<li>    Built-in algorithms (e.g., vehicle-to-grid, batteries, processes)</li>
<li>    Use cases for heating, cooling, charging and beyond</li>
<li>    Plugin/extensibility options (open source examples: OpenWeatherMap, ENTSO-E data platform)</li>
<li>    White-label solutions for branding the in-built UI</li>
<li>    Support for servicing customers: connectivity status pages, audit logs, monitoring</li>
<li>    Scalability: task queuing for distribution across CPUs</li>
<li>    Self-service: customers/partners can adapt device settings and graphs in the UI</li>
</ul>
<p>FlexMeasures fits into the modern energy stack as a “cloud EMS”. As devices become digitized and connectable, sites require some “<a href="https://withthegrid.com/what-is-an-on-site-ems-energy-management-system/">on-site EMS</a>” to control local flows – usually hardware with device integrations and business rules. FlexMeasures serves as a planning system which combines more information than is available locally, and plans the optimal schedules for the site.</p>

<p><i>Figure 3: Layers of a modern energy site</i></p>
<p>FlexMeasures features are constantly improved, but the two biggest additions on the roadmap are an algorithm dedicated to Virtual Power Plant settings (VPP) and adding support for open energy flexibility standards, like<a href="https://s2standard.org/"> S2</a> and<a href="https://www.openadr.org/"> OpenADR</a>, so FlexMeasures can become a tool within an open technology eco-system.</p>
<p><strong>Real World Domestic Energy Management Example: V2G App in The Netherlands</strong></p>
<p>Seita has used FlexMeasures to orchestrate the batteries of more than ten Nissan Leafs, each in their own building. The cars operate in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode, so apart from smart charging (taking advantage of longer parking times and local PV), the orchestration can also plan discharging back to the grid using dynamic energy tariffs. The local control (on-site EMS) has also been co-developed by Seita for this specific service. The cars charge and discharge schedules take into account user-defined set points (e.g. for longer rides) and keep the battery within user-defined limits (e.g. 20%-80% state of charge) and otherwise optimize economic results from the dynamic tariff (spot market prices).</p>
<figure class="aligncenter wp-image-10809 size-full"><i><img loading="lazy"  src="https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-4.png" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" srcset="https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-4.png 642w, https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-4-300x161.png 300w" alt="" width="642" height="344" data-is-external-image="true"></figure></i></p>
<p><i>Figure 4: The V2GLiberty dashboard, with smart charging schedules powered by FlexMeasures</i></p>
<p>As of Q1 2025, we have collected around three years of operational data (Q4 2022) and we see that less than 0.01€ has been paid for each driven kilometer. Yearly savings in charging costs per car between 1k€ and 1.5K€ are observed, confirming what other studies predict.

<p><strong>Why Open Source for Energy Flexibility?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.seita.nl">Seita Energy Flexibility</a>, the Dutch-German startup behind FlexMeasures, began their journey to tackle real-world energy challenges with smarter, more adaptable solutions in 2018. Recognizing the broader potential of their platform, Seita chose to open source FlexMeasures under LF Energy. This decision was driven by a commitment to maximizing their clean-tech impact, and to create a win-win innovation train fostering collaboration. Today Seita consists of a team of 10 people and offers scenario simulations and real-time cloud SaaS based on FlexMeasures.</p>

<p>There are several standards for connecting information about energy within buildings, and making devices controllable. There are some to connect them to external parties like aggregators and DSOs. All of this is interesting, but it is a wide field. It's unsure if and what FlexMeasures should implement here.</p>
<p>But some open protocols deal with what FlexMeasures is about: How to make joint decisions about energy sites, based on flexibility of the devices present?</p>
<p>S2 is one of those, and at Seita we are working towards supporting it from within FlexMeasures in several R&amp;D projects. This talk will mention them.</p>
<p>We also like <a href="https://www.openadr.org/">OpenADR</a>, and we will watch <a href="https://lfenergy.org/projects/shapeshifter/">ShapeShifter</a>. Hopefully the future will let us support those, as well ― we think they are complementary.</p>

                <div class="post__inner post__entry">
<p>Version v0.24 of FlexMeasures adds more expressive power for behind-the-meter scheduling constraints, and it also lets you design your graph dashboard. And we completed pagination in the UI.</p>
<p>This was actually a larger release (~70 PRs, three new committers). <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/latest/changelog.html#v0-24-0-january-07-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the changelog</a> for a complete list.</p>
<p>Let's dive in!</p>
</div>
<div class="post__inner post__entry">
<h2>Combine economic modelling options (e.g. peak costs &amp; prices)</h2>
<p>Behind-the-meter orchestration can become a complex problem, with multiple optimization goals potentially competing. So far, FlexMeasures could model hard constraints (e.g. consumption limit) and an optimization signal, usually a price per kWh. Both of these examples are penalties or rewards for energy commitments, that influence in distinct ways how the FlexMeasures scheduler will optimize the aggregated energy profile of the site.</p>
<p>But behind the meter, there are more intricate constraints, penalties and rewards, as different parties (e.g. the DSO, the day ahead market operator and the local business) have different ideas about how energy should be used. Especially the modeling of the congestion problem inspired us to extend how FlexMeasures can model the different needs.</p>
<p>With 0.24, any number of commitments which have their own reward or penalties can be modeled in the same optimization, and the scheduler will try to get the best overall profile.</p>
<p>This is a big step towards capturing more goals of behind-the-meter orchestration. It was not trivial to model this extension. From here on, FlexMeasures has much more expressive power!</p>
<p>Here is an example, which is inspired from a situation with a highly congested grid (as we experience in The Netherlands). Note that in the main PR you find a test which models this example, as well). Suppose that within the same optimization of schedules, we want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>use a day-ahead tariff for pricing our energy purchasing -&gt; buy low, sell high</li>
<li>model the DSO costs, as well (the DSO's monthly invoice depends on the highest peak) -&gt; modulate how high peaks get within the contracted capacity</li>
<li>allow breaching the contracted consumption capacity, but incentivize the scheduler (with a penalty) to attempt avoiding this as much as possible</li>
</ul>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2.png" alt="Illustration of possible options for the FlexMeasures scheduler after v0.24 (not exhaustive, e.g. set points are not shown)" width="879" height="546" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-2xl.png 1600w"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
<p>That last point seems counter-intuitive (allow breaching contracted capacity, but penalize it), but during simulations with different battery sizes, we found it invaluable that the contractual limits are not hard constraints, so we still get the best schedules, even on days where the battery cannot on its own keep the consumption within limits. Note that the <em>physical limits</em> can also be added, and should be hard constraints. </p>
<p>The scheduler will take all these goals into consideration, using existing and new flex-context fields like <code class="notranslate">site-peak-consumption-price</code>, <code class="notranslate">site-peak-consumption-breach</code>and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site-peak-consumption</span></code> (check <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/scheduling.html#the-flex-context" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the documentation</a> for details).</p>
<p>Note that after the fact, the actual reporting of costs can represent what will actually be invoiced, e.g. energy purchasing (dynamic tariff) and peak costs by the DSO, but not the penalty used to avoid peak breaches.</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1144</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1254</a>.</p>
<h2>Editing your own graph dashboard in the UI</h2>
<p>The asset page is where FlexMeasures shows you data (measurements, schedules, etc) in graphs. As your use cases and sites differ, your needs for this graph dashboard will differ. Previously, it was possible to configure different graphs and plots, but it required editing a JSON field. As of version 0.24, you can edit what you want to see right in the UI:</p>

<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1212</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1145</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1152</a>.</p>
<h2>More pagination in UI for faster browsing</h2>
<p>When a lot of data is being shown, FlexMeasures' pages could get slow. In <a href="https://flexmeasures.io/023-data-insights-and-white-labelling/">v0.23</a>, we already started adding pagination parameters to API endpoints for assets and users. This now includes also accounts and audit logs, and we finished our work on all FlexMeasures UI pages, so that they now only load small batches of entries at a time.</p>

                <p>Great news - FlexMeasures receives another scheduling algorithm, which is more suitable for VPP (Virtual Power Plant) applications. It has been developed by TNO earlier, and the transfer into FlexMeasures is part of another R&amp;D project.</p>
<p>In short, it is a dynamic programming approach, which sets a goal to flexibly divert a fleet of assets from its aggregated consumption and then asks all assets to add contributions to this goal until it is reached. This is a different approach to <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/device_scheduler.html">the existing storage scheduler in FlexMeasures</a>, which does a good job on a site-level with economic optimization.</p>
<p>In the R&amp;D project (called "KIFLIN") we will work on the seamless integration of that algorithm into FlexMeasures' existing strengths - namely giving software developers a robust tool to build energy services. The way APIs and UIs work should be the same, no matter which of the schedulers you choose to use.</p>
<p><span class="break-words
          tvm-parent-container"><span dir="ltr">Nicolas spoke about this collaboration at the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/lfenergysummit/">LF Energy summit in Brussels</a> recently (5 Sep). This project is special for several reasons:<br><br>- it can be seen as a win-win between past and future R&amp;D projects, by transferring knowledge into a more re-usable form. FlexMeasures gets an algorithm donated which was developed by <a href="http://www.tno.nl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TNO</a> - this is the aspect highlighted in the lightning talk below (~10 minutes)<br>- it will progress <a href="https://s2standard.org/">S2</a> standard implementation in FlexMeasures and also a heat pump OEM (Itho Daalderop) is on board - S2 is an exciting open standard for assets and EMS to exchange information on what is possible w.r.t. energy flexibility. <br>- FlexMeasures will get (even nicer) tutorials for other organizations to get started with using it as HEMS</span></span></p>

<p>Version v0.23 of FlexMeasures adds more data insights on the sensor page, so you can understand faster what datasets you are working on. We also added white-labelling, so you can automatically style the UI in the branding of customers. Finally, the flex-context and flex-model are (still) growing more powerful in terms of expressing dynamic information.</p>
<p>This was actually a lager release. For anything else, <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/latest/changelog.html#v0-23-0-september-18-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see the changelog</a> for a complete list.</p>
<p>Let's dive in!</p>
</div>
<div class="post__inner post__entry">
<h2>Data insights on the sensor page</h2>
<p>The data sets each sensor stores are what sits beneath the scheduling. If the data has low quality, so will your schedules. We saw in projects how true this is, and wanted to show ourselves and customers quickly what actually is stored in a sensor.</p>
<p>We made two crucial additions to the sensor page in FlexMeasures.<br><br>First, we now summarise what the sensor is about (sensor properties), and what data you find (statistics):</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/Sensor-properties-stats.png" alt="" width="850" height="350" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Sensor-properties-stats-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Sensor-properties-stats-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Sensor-properties-stats-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Sensor-properties-stats-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Sensor-properties-stats-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Sensor-properties-stats-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>Because on any sensor, we store data from different sources, the statistics are available per source!</p>
<p>Second, we added a histogram. Sometimes, that is the best way to understand what values you can find in general:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/histogram-visualisation.png" alt="" width="850" height="311" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/histogram-visualisation-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/histogram-visualisation-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/histogram-visualisation-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/histogram-visualisation-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/histogram-visualisation-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/histogram-visualisation-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>We already had two visualizations - bar chart and heat map. With this third one, it was time to make the "Select Chart" option more prominent (it moved out of the daterange selector).</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1115</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1116</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1143</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1148</a>.</p>
<h2>White-labelling</h2>
<p>We have partners who want to present schedules and reports in FlexMeasures' UI, even if we are hosting FlexMeasures for them. They would love to brand the UI in their colors and logo.</p>
<p>For this, we added the ability to set primary and secondary colors for each account, as well as a logo URL. Here is a simple (not necessarily beautiful) impression of how FlexMeasures' UI will adapt:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/1920-1080-max.png" alt="" width="850" height="107" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/1920-1080-max-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/1920-1080-max-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/1920-1080-max-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/1920-1080-max-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/1920-1080-max-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/1920-1080-max-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>This also brings the ability to edit account settings (like the name).</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1137</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1145</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1152</a>.</p>
<h2>More expressive flex-context and flex-model</h2>
<p>Within FlexMeasures, the <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/scheduling.html#the-flex-context">flex-context</a> is crucial: it tells us site-relevant parameters such as pricing and grid capacity limits. The flex-model is evenly important: it tells us about the situation on the ground (e.g. current state of charge, limits to it, set points, ...).</p>
<p>Expressing these is thus a regular task when modelling a site in FlexMeasures and asking it for schedules. That should be developer-friendly and powerful. E.g. a site constraint can be a static kW value, but also point to a sensor, where the different capacities per time of day are recorded.</p>
<p>In v0.23, we made substantial progress on both goals.</p>
<p>We merged existing approaches in a single schema, <code class="notranslate">VariableQuantityField</code> (we also made sure we remain backwards-compatible for a while).</p>
<p>Now, across all of flex-context and flex-model, there are different ways to tell FlexMeasures about the optimization problem:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>As a constant quantity, such as:
<div class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
<pre class="notranslate"><code class="notranslate">"10 kW"
</code></pre>
<div class="zeroclipboard-container position-absolute right-0 top-0">Note that the unit is part of the message. This is the most direct &amp; easy way.<br><br></div>
</div>
</li>
<li>As a time series, such as:
<div class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
<pre class="notranslate"><code class="notranslate">[
    {
        "value": 51,
        "start": "2024-02-04T10:35:00+01:00",
        "end": "2024-02-05T04:25:00+01:00"
    }
]
</code></pre>
<div class="zeroclipboard-container position-absolute right-0 top-0">This is making it easy to describe temporary blocks, e.g. a few hours where the state of charge should not go below a certain value. <br>(NB this example assumes the unit is specified via a separate field).<br><br></div>
</div>
</li>
<li>As a sensor, such as:
<div class="snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto">
<pre class="notranslate"><code class="notranslate">{
    "sensor": 101
}</code><code class="notranslate"></code></pre>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In the last example, the data's meta information (such as units) is stored in the sensor objects, and the data is looked up via the sensor table. This is best for highly dynamic data, e.g. prices loaded by a third-party API.</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1127</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1152" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1138</a>.</p>
<p>One more thing in this domain: We can also now express prices as fixed quantities - they were always modelled as series before. Sometimes that is what is needed to test a control strategy. See Pull Request <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/1028" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1028</a>.</p>
<h2>Faster asset &amp; account page</h2>
<p>When a lot of accounts and assets are added, we noticed that FlexMeasures took too ling for admins to load the complete lists. We addressed some speed bumps and also added pagination in the asset API and UI, so that the user experience improves.</p>
<p>See Pull Request <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">988</a>.</p>
<h2>Adding titles to graphs</h2>
<p>The graphs on the asset page are the go-to place for watching schedules next to the underlying data. Basically, there we find the data dashboard in FlexMeasures. <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/views/asset-data.html#the-asset-page-as-data-dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The sensor_to_show attribute</a> which directs the setup of this dashbaord became more powerful. </p>

Yes, the socializing happened with Belgian beer :)</p>
<p>We also gave a 45-minute demo about FlexMeasures. I believe we have seldom gotten so into depth in a public session. Usually, like in Steering Committee meetings or other public settings, we only take a few minutes to outline what FlexMeasures is and what features it has. And we got a lot of interesting questions back, thank you everyone for the great discussion, which lasted another 20 minutes or so. </p>
<p>Sadly, there is no video, but here are the slides:</p>

<p>Let's dive in!</p>
</div>
<div class="post__inner post__entry">
<h2>Editing flex-context</h2>
<p>Within FlexMeasures, the <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/scheduling.html#the-flex-context">flex-context</a> is crucial: it tells us site-relevant parameters such as pricing and grid capacity limits.</p>
<p>As of now, both the flex-model and the flex-context need to be supplied when <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/v3_0.html#post--api-v3_0-sensors-(id)-schedules-trigger">triggering the computation of a new schedule</a>. The future needs to be that such configuration can be made by everyone, not just developers. Maybe installers change the <code>soc-min</code> setting for the battery. Or there is a letter from the DSO that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">site-production-capacity</span></code>for the site can now go up to 50kW. Several non-developer roles should be able to make these changes.</p>
<p>Here, we made the first step towards this. The screenshot shows how you can select which sensors contain the pricing data that will be relevant, plus which devices the scheduler needs to take into account.</p>

<h2>Boostrap 3 -&gt; 5</h2>
<p><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is our styling and layout library. When we started working on FlexMeasures a few years ago, version 3 was the latest. Now, it has version 5, which looks a little more slick but also has some newer features. It was time to make this move. Which sounds boring, but this is where we believe we can show actual dedication to long-time support. </p>
<p>See Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1058" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1058</a>, plus some follow-up PRs for fixes.</p>
<h2>Asset audit log</h2>
<p>In version 0.21 we introduced audit logs for users and accounts, so servicing them gets more support (e.g. to track when somebody reset a password). We also added audit log support to assets. This will for instance track when changes were made to an asset.</p>
<p>This can be handy for instance in combination with flex-context changes like discussed above.</p>

<p>Version v0.21 of FlexMeasures adds business value which comes through happy customers. Why does this matter? An app which deals with real-time complexities like energy optimization needs to an excellent help desk ― next to getting optimal scheduling right, it's crucial to find out quickly why something is not going according to expectations.</p>
<p>Imagine the customer on the phone with your service or technical staff. How to start investigating where it went wrong?</p>
<p>To help with this situation, version v0.21 of FlexMeasures brings two major features that can help you provide better support for your customers ― a status page for assets and an audit log for accounts &amp; users.</p>
<p>Other than that, there are some smaller improvements, notably to link to specific date ranges on the asset page. <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/latest/changelog.html#v0-21-0-may-16-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the changelog</a> for a complete list (link will work on May 16, day of release). </p>

<h2>Status page</h2>
<p>A site which is being optimized with FlexMeasures usually has a few assets (some flexible, some not) from which recent data is required. This data sometimes comes from different sources, e.g. sent through the API by the monitoring partner, and gotten through a third-party API. We need to be able to see if all of this data is coming in correctly. If not, scheduling will probably fail due to missing data.</p>
<p>We created a status page which lets you see if the necessary data connectivity is given. Also, we show the recent forecasting jobs and whether they succeeded or failed.</p>

<p>We are still improving the status page. It will become <a href="https://github.com/SeitaBV/timely-beliefs/pull/179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faster</a> in the next version, and we might add even more information. </p>
<h2>Audit log</h2>
<p>Next to the raw data and scheduling, an important part of the user experience are accounts. Has a user been created correctly, or set to being inactive, or has a password been rest? And who did that?</p>
<p>Answering such questions can be an important building block in providing good service without big hassle.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/40/audit-log.png" alt="" width="750" height="236" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/40/responsive/audit-log-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/40/responsive/audit-log-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/40/responsive/audit-log-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/40/responsive/audit-log-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/40/responsive/audit-log-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/40/responsive/audit-log-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>We will also soon extend the audit log for other important events, like important changes on the asset attributes (which would also influence how scheduling goes) or additions of new assets.</p>
<p>You can of course also make use of the audit log in your own plugin logic. Put in here what is important to you and your help desk.</p>
<p>See Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1042</a>.</p>
<h2>Linking to a custom time range of data</h2>
<p>It is also useful to point someone to a specific point in the data. "This specific Saturday shows scheduling behavior that seems off to me". </p>
<p>We now support linking to the asset page (where a dashboard shows data) with the date range contained in the URL. The date range picker adds start and end date to the URL. You can also click a link symbol beneath the dashboard to copy the URL to your clipboard.</p>
