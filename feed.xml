<p>Version v0.20 of FlexMeasures brings a major speed improvement when reading times series data, which makes loading graphs much faster than before. Other than that, there are power tools for FlexMeasures hosts, more work on flexibility modelling with dynamic times series data and some smaller fixes and improvements.</p>
<p><a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-20-0-march-26-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the changelog</a> for a complete list. Read on below about the larger new features we added.</p>
</div>
<div class="post__inner post__entry">
<h2>Speed</h2>
<p>Loading data has been too slow, which was mostly visible when loading charts in the asset and sensor UIs. We found two issues and addressed both, which has led to a major speed improvement. Loading charts now feels more natural.</p>
<p>The improvements actually happened in the data model library timely-beliefs at <a href="https://pypi.org/project/timely-beliefs/2.1.0/">version 2.1.0</a>, see PRs <a href="https://github.com/SeitaBV/timely-beliefs/pull/166">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SeitaBV/timely-beliefs/pull/167">here</a>. We also have been patched this version into FlexMeasures 0.19.2</p>
<h2>Power-user tooling for hosts to move assets &amp; data around</h2>
<p>Hosting FlexMeasures means to manage accounts, their assets and their data. Sometimes you need some powerful tooling to move things.</p>
<ul>
<li>We introduce a new command to transfer the ownership of an asset and its children to a different account. Example: 
<pre class="notranslate"><code class="notranslate">flexmeasures edit transfer-ownership --asset 1 --account 2</code></pre>
 See Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">983</a>.</li>
<li>And it is now simple to delete time series data for an entire site (i.e. with child assets) while keeping its structure, including asset and sensor IDs, intact. We added the <code class="notranslate" style="font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">--offspring</code><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> flag to the command </span><code class="notranslate" style="font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">flexmeasures delete beliefs</code><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> which will include the beliefs of the offspring assets' sensors to the list of to-be-removed beliefs. See Pull Request </span><a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">1003</a><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">.</span></li>
<li>Also, deleting time series data via the CLI command <code class="notranslate" style="font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">flexmeasures delete beliefs</code><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> </span>is much faster now, too. See Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1005</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Flex info as sensors</h2>
In our <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/discussions/957">ongoing effort</a> to describe (most of) our <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/scheduling.html#the-flex-context">flex-model</a> and <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/scheduling.html#the-flex-context">flex-context</a> in dynamic settings (instead only constant values), we are still plowing ahead:</div>
<ul>
<li class="post__inner post__entry">FlexMeasures now supports the <code>site-consumption-capacity</code> and <code>site-production-capacity</code> fields in the flex-context to be sensors (and thus represent time series) - an interesting use case from (Dutch) reality is a contract with the DSO where your capacity is higher for some hours, e.g. during the night. See Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">985</a><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">. </span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">Here is an example:</span>
<pre class="notranslate">{
    <span class="pl-ent">"flex-context"</span>: {
        <span class="pl-ent">"site-power-capacity"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>500 kVA<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
        <span class="pl-ent">"site-consumption-capacity"</span>: {<span class="pl-ent">"sensor"</span>: <span class="pl-c1">8</span>},
        <span class="pl-ent">"site-production-capacity"</span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>400 kW<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>,
    }
}</pre>
</li>
<li>We added the possibility to define SOC (State of Charge) Targets, SOC Maxima and SOC Minima as sensors. For example: <code><span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass " data-code-marker="+"><span class="pl-s">"soc-minima": {"sensor" : 300}</span></span></code> The existing way of defining those (within API calls) is still supported.<br>Why is this useful? Well, these flex-model fields are quite powerful in defining the storage boundaries within which FlexMeasures shall compute the best schedules. Ans these storage boundaries usually come from the user's environment, e.g. as targets for EVs to be charged, comfort-optimized settings for heating or from production planning in an industry setting. Thus, this data is important enough to be stored in its own sensor ― then it can easily be updated from a different data source (e.g. EV logistics system) and be displayed on its own. We believe this makes for a more powerful FlexMeasures :) <br>See Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">996</a><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>As we mentioned, there were several smaller but crucial improvements. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>The unit of non-schedulable (inflexible) sensors had to be MW. Now it can be any power unit, e.g. kW, kWh or MWh, which ever you represent it as. FlexMeasures converts the data when reading it from the database and feeding it to the scheduler. See Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1007</a>. </li>
<li>FlexMeasures can now be run on MacOS. There were some package installation troubles. This might be quite crucial for developers on MacOS (although they could have used docker compose). See Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1000</a>. </li>
</ul>

                <p>At <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/">FOSDEM 2024</a>, there was an <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/energy/">energy devroom</a> again (2nd time). As <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/energy_v2gliberty/">we talked about using FlexMeasures in an open vehicle-to-grid (V2G) stack last time</a>, we wanted to be a bit more hands-on this time. After all, FOSDEM is a developer conference.</p>
<p>So we designed a quick 15-minute tutorial which gives you a tour of how to integrate with FlexMeasures if you were to build your own smart heating startup (and use FlexMeasures as a smart backend). The video is right here, enjoy:</p>
<figure class="post__video"><video loading="lazy" width="650" height="300" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1">

<p>We covered these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a new customer account with the relevant asset models for this use case (via a new API endpoint, e.g. called from your CRM)</li>
<li>feed local measurements (e.g. temperature) regularly into your FlexMeasures server, using the FlexMeasures Python client</li>
<li>get the latest price and weather forecast data from third-party-APIs (regularly via cron jobs), using existing FlexMeasures plugins</li>
<li>call the FlexMeasures scheduler to compute when to draw green &amp; cheap electricity for heating (via the FlexMeasures API) which you can out to use in the building</li>
<li>define a cost reporter and let it run (regularly via cron jobs)</li>
<li>configure a FlexMeasures dashboard to show the relevant data in one place</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot for 15 minutes, and we didn't even touch all possibilities. A big thank you to the volunteer staff at FOSDEM, who made sure you can re-watch this now.<br><br>If you have questions about these presented topics, do make sure to <a href="https://flexmeasures.io/get-in-touch/">contact us</a>.</p>

<p>Version v0.19 of FlexMeasures has a few minor improvements, each of which might mean a lot to someone. We'll focus on our first steps into nested asset structures, as it is visual and part of FlexMeasures' strategic roadmap. </p>
<p><a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-19-0-februari-18-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the changelog</a> for a complete list. Read on below about the larger new features we added.</p>
</div>
<div class="post__inner post__entry">
<h2>UI navigation of nested sites</h2>
<p>Behind the scenes, we work with more complex asset structures. We have introduced the capability of assets being the child of another asset. Now, tree-like structures can be built (where sensors are the leaves, usually) in order to model whole sites or different scenarios for simulation projects.</p>
<p>This also calls for efforts to navigate this structures. We are looking to develop a visual representation of this tree-structure. But until we get there, we made it easier to navigate the structure.</p>
<p>(Note: We actually started work on this in v0.18, but now we have a more complete picture)</p>
<p>First, we introduced a breadcrump-bar above the asset and sensor pages. This example has the account, the asset and the currently shown sensor:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/breadcrump-example.png" alt="Breadcrumps bar in FlexMeasures" width="500" height="172" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/breadcrump-example-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/breadcrump-example-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/breadcrump-example-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/breadcrump-example-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/breadcrump-example-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/breadcrump-example-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Second, we added a drop-down on the last breadcrump, should there be a lot of child assets. Highly useful for navigating charging hubs:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed.png" alt="" width="500" height="456" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Third, we added a list of child assets to each asset page:</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517.png" alt="" width="1105" height="700" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/930" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">930</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">967</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">977</a>.</p>
<p>We believe this is useful for everyone, even if your site is small and you optimize only one asset, but you still have other (inflexible) ones.</p>
<p>However, the next steps will be to make sure the in-built schedulers can be told to optimise an asset structure with multiple flexible assets, like a charging hub. At <a href="https://www.seita.nl">Seita</a>, we are working on this internally at the moment on a few projects.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>As we mentioned, there were several smaller but crucial improvements. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>SoC-minima and maxima as ranges: It's now much easier for developers to tell FlexMeasures (via the flex-model in API requests) that minima and maxima of storage levels should be kept for whole ranges of time points, see Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">899</a>. </li>
<li>Support for ARM-based processors (e.g. Macbooks). Some installations, like docker compose, would not build correctly on MacBooks or Raspberry Pis. We believe we have found a fix, see Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">956</a>. </li>
<li>Support SQLAlchemy 2.0 - an important library for data modeling in Python, which we use in many many places changes its syntax. So this was an important chore, to be able to stay up to data, see Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">938</a>. </li>
<li>Support Flask 2.3 - this also holds for Flask. The changes we needed to make here were not that many, but it's crucial chore work. See Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">907</a>. </li>

<p><a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-18-0-december-21-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See the changelog</a> for a complete list. Read on below about the larger new features we added.</p>
<h2>Future knowledge in scheduling</h2>
<p>FlexMeasures lets you describe the underlying flexibility problem, so that the internal scheduler knows within what limits to work to find the best solution for the upcoming hours. Earlier, we introduced two data specifications for this, the <code>flex-model</code> (what are the limits and goal around this asset, e.g. maximal state of charge?) and the <code>flex-context</code> (what is also relevant, e.g. prices?). We wrote <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/v2g.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a tutorial with nice examples</a> around the V2G use case.</p>
<p>Now, we have enhanced the flex-model with three new (or more nuanced) types of information, which lets FlexMeasures handle a wider range of modern energy flexibility problems. We also let them be sensors, instead of just one constant value. But more about that later, first let me introduce the new kinds of flex-model information:</p>
<h3>External in- and output for storage</h3>
<p>We can model storage assets which only serve the flexibility of the main system, e.g. a battery which only exists to simply buffer solar energy for self-consumption at some later time. The battery has no strict dependencies outside of our energy flexibility asset model.</p>
<p>But often, storage (also) serves an external and crucial purpose. A good example is a hot water tank. Comfort of the home occupants is the main goal ― consuming energy to create heat at the best time is also important, but secondary.</p>
<p>Thus, the expected extraction of energy (as heat) from the storage is an important input to the modeling problem ― it will form a constraint. In this example, the input of energy (as electricity) is dynamic, and can be timed optimally to lower the energy costs and/pr CO2.</p>
<p>To handle these situations optimally, we introduced fields in the flex model to represent an expected extraction of stored energy (e.g. when we know the occupants are at home), or even addition (e.g. when an industrial process will add heat) ― we called them <span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass " data-code-marker="+"><code><span class="pl-c1">soc-usage</span></code> and <span class="pl-c1"><code><span class="pl-token">soc</span>-gain</code><span class="pl-token">. This makes the flex model much more expressive. Obviously, these fields only work with the <code>StorageScheduler</code>.</span></span></span></p>
<h3>Energy conversion efficiency</h3>
<div>We noticed that the efficiency of turning electricity into usable energy is a crucial modelling factor, especially when modeling smart heating problems. <br>in earlier version, we supported conversion losses with a constant <span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass " data-code-marker="+"><span class="pl-en"><span class="pl-s"><code>roundtrip-efficiency</code></span></span></span> value. Used as a percentage, this works well enough for batteries or even for heat losses that happen in an inverter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As an example where that breaks down, consider that the COP of Heat Pumps typically depends strongly on the outside temperature. To be able to model this more precisely within the optimization problem (losses are a crucial detail here), you can now use <span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass " data-code-marker="+"><span class="pl-en"><span class="pl-s"><code>charging-efficiency</code> and <code>discharging-efficiency</code> separately, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> they can be time series (more about that below). The latter feature is what you need if the conditions for energy conversion efficiency are not constant, like outside temperature.</span></span></span></div>
<h3>Consumption and production capacities</h3>
<p>Until now, only one kind of maximal capacity was possible (for example, to describe a limit to the grid connection). We used the field <code>power-capacity</code>, and it had to have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one</span> constant value, e.g. 25 kW.</p>
</div>
<div><br>We made this more expressive. Look at the example below. </div>
<div class="post__inner post__entry">
<pre class="notranslate"><code class="notranslate">{
    "flex-model": {
        "consumption-capacity": "25 kW",
        "production-capacity": {"sensor": 51}
    }
}</code></pre>
We can now differentiate between limits on production and consumption. <code>power-capacity</code>still works ― if it is given, it would serve as a limit on the other two.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Varying values over time!</h3>
<div class="post__inner post__entry">Look at the above example for <code>production-capacity</code> again. This is not a constant value, but references a sensor. The added value here is that the allowed production capacity can vary over time.</div>
<div class="post__inner post__entry">This might soon be relevant in practice, as DSOs offer network contracts in which businesses have a varying grid connection capacity! (next to offering, they might even force businesses to use them, if grid congestion is high).</div>
<div> </div>
<div class="post__inner post__entry">But also for the two other examples we discussed above (where values can also be a constant number or a sensor from now on), a varying series of values might help you model reality more closely.</div>
<div class="post__inner post__entry">
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">906,</a> <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">933</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/897" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">897</a>. </p>
<h2>UI navigation of complex sites</h2>
<p>Behind the scenes, we work with more complex asset structures. We have introduced the capability of assets being the child of another asset. Now, tree-like structures can be built (where sensors are the leaves, usually) in order to model whole sites or different scenarios for simulation projects.</p>
<p>This also calls for efforts to navigate this structures. We are looking to develop a visual representation of this tree-structure. But until we get there, we made it easier to navigate the structure.</p>
<p>First, we introduced a breadcrump-bar above the asset and sensor pages. This example has the account, the asset and the currently shown sensor:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/breadcrump-example.png" alt="Breadcrumps bar in FlexMeasures" width="500" height="172" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>Second, we made lists of assets and sensors easy to click. The whole row will now react to one simple click and take you where you want to go!</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/930" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">930</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">923</a>.</p>

<p>Version v0.17 of FlexMeasures lets you elevate some accounts to be consultants of other accounts. It also increases robustness of scheduling, by using fallbacks. And a new favicon!</p>
<p><a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-17-0-november-8-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See changelog</a> for a complete list or read on below about the larger new features we added.</p>
<h2>Consultancy</h2>
<p>FlexMeasures is a good fit for ESCos - energy service companies who work for clients like businesses or households, and optimize their energy management.</p>
<p>Both the ESCo and the client should have distinct accounts in FlexMeasures. And the ESCo should be able to consult their clients, for instance for servicing questions and problems. And this means to see their data.</p>
<p>We now enabled that. This unlocks using FlexMeasures in more powerful hosting scenarios.</p>
<p>Each account can now have a consultant account linked. Users in that account who have the role <code>consultant</code> will now be able to see the client's asset and data. In the UI, each client's account page shows who their consultant is, and consultants will see who their client accounts are and can access them from there. The API also allows read access for consultants.</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">877</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/892" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">892</a>. </p>
<p>Future work might add the ability to also add or edit assets and sensors.</p>
<h2>Fallback schedulers<code></code></h2>
<p>Sometimes a schedule might not be feasible. This happens for example when a strict state-of-charge target for a storage was set, but can't be reached in time. In FlexMeasures, a fallback scheduler can then try to reach as close to that target as possible. But it's crucial to deal with this situation and visualize it.</p>
<p>We enabled for FlexMasures hosts that they separate background jobs in this case (e.g. one run by <code>StorageScheduler</code> and one run by <code>FallbackStorageScheduler</code>). By giving them distinct data sources, it can also be visualized better in the UI that the schedules are somewhat different (a "perfect" one and a "good enough" one).</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">846</a>,  <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/841" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">841</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/888" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">888</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">891</a>.</p>
<h2>New favicon: <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/35/favicon.ico" alt="" width="32" height="32"></figure></h2>
<p>We noticed that the FlexMeasures UI was not using a favicon which represents its logo (within LF Energy). Pull request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">895</a> adds it!</p>

<p>Version v0.16 of FlexMeasures advances the state of art on reporting by offering a very useful implementation (and a tutorial how to bring it to practice). We also add a command to get charts via the CLI and add capacity limits as a field in the flex context.</p>
<p><a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-16-0-september-27-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See changelog</a> for a complete list or read on below about the larger new features we added.</p>
<h2>ProfitOrLoss reporter &amp; Tutorial</h2>
<p>Reporting capabilities were introduced in <a href="https://flexmeasures.io/014-reporting-power/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v0.14</a>. We are continuing to make it more useful. We already made it possible to have a reporter aggregate sensors (<code><cite>AggregatorReporter</cite></code>) or use Pandas methods on sensor data (<code><cite>PandasReporter</cite></code>) ― this had a lot of power so KPIs could be made.</p>
<p>In this version, we added an implementation that should cover a use case right off the shelf for almost everyone using FlexMeasures: a reporter to compute how profitable your operation has been (<em><code>ProfitOrLossReporter</code></em>). Showing the results of optimization is a crucial feature, and now easier than ever.</p>
<p>We also wrote <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tut/toy-example-reporter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a tutorial</a> for using it in your installation. Here are some excerpts (note that that tutorial also shows other reporting types).</p>
<p>First, reporters can now be stored as data sources, so they are easy to be used repeatedly and the data they generate can reference them. Our data source has "ProfitOrLossReporter" as <code>model</code> attribute and these <code>attributes</code> (the least a ProfitOrLossReporter needs to know is a price): </p>
<pre id="codecell2"><span class="o">{</span>
<span class="s2">   "data_generator"</span>: <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="s2">     "config"</span>: <span class="o">{</span>
<span class="s2">       "consumption_price_sensor"</span>: <span class="m">1<br></span>     <span class="o">}<br></span><span class="o">   }<br></span><span class="o">}</span></pre>
<p>And here is excerpts from the tutorial in how to configure and create a report:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate">
<div class="highlight">
<pre>$ <span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"</span>
$<span class="s2"> {</span>
$<span class="s2">     'input' : [{'sensor' : 4}],</span>
$<span class="s2">     'output' : [{'sensor' : 9}]</span>
$<span class="s2"> }"</span> &gt; profitorloss-parameters.json</pre>
</div>
<div>
<p><cite>The input</cite> sensor stores the power/energy flow, and the <cite>output</cite> sensor will store the report.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate">
<div class="highlight">
<pre id="codecell7">$ flexmeasures add report --source <span class="m">6</span> <span class="se">\</span>
   --parameters profitorloss-parameters.json <span class="se">\</span>
   --start-offset DB,1D --end-offset DB,2D
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>With these offsets, we indicate that we want the report to encompass the day of tomorrow (see Pandas offset strings). The chart below then shows all costs which we know will be made tomorrow by the simple process scheduler in the tutorial.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/34/sensor-data-inflexible.png" alt="Simple profit reporter chart" width="750" height="314" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/34/responsive/sensor-data-inflexible-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/34/responsive/sensor-data-inflexible-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/34/responsive/sensor-data-inflexible-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/34/responsive/sensor-data-inflexible-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/34/responsive/sensor-data-inflexible-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/34/responsive/sensor-data-inflexible-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/808" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">808</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/825" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">825</a>, and <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">818</a>. </p>
<h2>Charts via the CLI</h2>
<p>For documentation purposes, generating charts is sometimes very useful. For instance, we might want to send a chart to a client (in lieu of them having an account set up and us sending a link to the chart). Or we are supposed to create a Word document.</p>
<p>The new command <code class="notranslate">flexmeasures show chart</code> can export sensor and asset charts. <br>Here is an example:</p>
<p><code>flexmeasures show chart --start 2023-08-15T00:00:00+02:00 --end 2023-08-16T00:00:00+02:00 --asset 1 --sensor 14 --sensor 15 --filename 'chart-$now-$entity_type-$id.png'</code></p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/833" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">833</a>.</p>
<h2>Capacity limits as a field in the flex context</h2>
<p>The limit to a storage device or the grid connection are crucial information for FlexMeasures' algorithm. The way this could be encoded before was not very user-friendly (as asset or sensor attribute). We have now added the fields <code class="notranslate">storage_power_capacity_in_mw</code> and <code class="notranslate">ems_power_capacity_in_mw</code>, respectively, so that the flex model can encode this explicitly (the flex model can be sent to the API when triggering schedules and soon be stored on the asset itself).</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">850</a>.</p>

<p>Version v0.15 of FlexMeasures brings the ability to schedule energy processes and adds a new data visualization: Daily activity heatmap. Finally, we add API support for managing sensors.</p>
<p><a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-15-0-august-09-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See changelog</a> for a complete list or read on below about the larger new features we added.</p>
<h2>Scheduling energy processes</h2>
<p>FlexMeasures' <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/device_scheduler.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in-built device scheduler</a> works best for storage devices like batteries or heat buffers, which can have any flow. We sometimes encounter situations where the flexibility lies in a steady process, which has to happen during some time window. Usually, this is a feature in process-heavy industry settings like water purification or paper manufacturing.</p>
<p>We have now added the process scheduler to be used in such scenarios. Let's say you need a process which takes 45 kW of power, and it needs to run 14 hours before tomorrow ― you have 10 hours of flexibility! Given some cost signal (like prices, or CO2), you can tell FlexMeasures to find the best running times. </p>
<p>Here is an overview of what you can tell FlexMeasures about your process optimization needs (this is the flex model):</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass" data-code-marker="+"><code><span class="pl-c1"><span class="pl-token">power</span></span></code>: <span class="pl-token">nominal</span> <span class="pl-token">power</span> <span class="pl-token">of</span> <span class="pl-token">the</span> <span class="pl-token">process</span></span></li>
<li><span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass" data-code-marker="+"><code><span class="pl-c1"><span class="pl-token">duration</span></span></code>: <span class="pl-token">time</span> <span class="pl-token">that</span> <span class="pl-token">the</span> <span class="pl-token">process</span> <span class="pl-token">lasts</span></span></li>
<li><span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass" data-code-marker="+"><code><span class="pl-c1"><span class="pl-token">optimization_sense</span></span></code>: <span class="pl-token">objective</span> <span class="pl-token">of</span> <span class="pl-token">the</span> <span class="pl-token">scheduler</span>, to <span class="pl-token">maximize</span> <span class="pl-token">or</span> <span class="pl-token">minimize</span></span></li>
<li><span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass" data-code-marker="+"><code><span class="pl-c1"><span class="pl-token">time_restrictions</span></span></code>: <span class="pl-token">time</span> <span class="pl-token">periods</span> <span class="pl-token">in</span> <span class="pl-token">which</span> <span class="pl-token">the</span> <span class="pl-token">load</span> <span class="pl-token">cannot</span> <span class="pl-token">be</span> <span class="pl-token">schedule</span> <span class="pl-token">to</span></span></li>
<li><span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass" data-code-marker="+"><code><span class="pl-c1"><span class="pl-token">load_type</span></span></code>: <span class="pl-token">Inflexible</span>, <span class="pl-token">Breakable</span> <span class="pl-token">or</span> <span class="pl-token">Shiftable</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Note the load_type:</p>
<p>Plus, in <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/notation.html#flex-context" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the flexibility context</a>, you can (as usual) add a <code>consumption-price-sensor</code>.</p>
<p>This scheduler is available through the API when you <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/v3_0.html#post--api-v3_0-sensors-(id)-schedules-trigger">trigger a new schedule for a sensor</a> on an asset with type "process" or "load".</p>
<p>We also made a CLI command for computing schedules like this:</p>
<pre class="notranslate"><code class="notranslate">flexmeasures add schedule for-process <br>    --sensor-id 4 --process-type SHIFTABLE</code><code class="notranslate">    --start 2023-07-23T00:00:00+01:00 <br>    --duration PT24H --process-duration PT4H --process-power 0.4MW</code><code class="notranslate">    --consumption-price-sensor 2 <br>    --forbid '{"start": "${TOMORROW}T14:00:00+02:00", "duration" : "PT1H"}'</code></pre>
<p>We documented usage of this new scheduler <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tut/toy-example-process.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">729</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">768</a>, and <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">777</a>. </p>
<h2>New data visualization: Daily activity heatmap</h2>
<p>Heatmaps are great ways to spot the hotspots of activity. Usually heatmaps are actually geographical maps. In our context, the most interesting background is time ― so we'd like to see activity hotspots on a map of time intervals.</p>
<p>We chose the "time map" of weekdays. From our experience, this is where you see the most interesting activity hotspots at a glance. For instance, that mornings often experience peaks. Or that Tuesday afternoons have low energy use, for some reason.</p>
<p>Here is how it looks like for one week of temperature data:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18.png" alt="Temperature data in new heatmap" width="800" height="239" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<figcaption>It's easy to see which days had milder temperatures.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And here are 4 days of (dis)-charging patterns in Seita's <a href="https://v2g-liberty.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V2GLiberty</a> project:</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img  src="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf.png" alt="" width="800" height="249" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf-2xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<figcaption>Charging (blue) mostly happens in sunshine hours, discharging during high-price hours (morning &amp; evening)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So on a technical level, the daily heatmap is essentially a heatmap of the sensor's values, with dates on the y-axis and time of day on the x-axis. For individual devices, it gives an insight into the device's running times. A new button lets users switch between charts.</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">715</a>.</p>
<h2>Manage sensors in API</h2>
<p>Until now, it was possible to work on assets via the FlexMeasures API, but it had no CRUD capabilities for sensors. We now added GET, POST, PATCH and DELETE endpoints, so talking to FlexMeasures from the outside becomes more powerful. Custom frontends or installations using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flexmeasures-client/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the FlexMeasures Client</a> can fully build up complete asset-sensor structures on their own (the client will be updated to reflect this soon).</p>

<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">We've taken a crucial step in making FlexMeasures even more developer-friendly! Last week, we released version 0.1 of the new <a href="https://pypi.org/project/flexmeasures-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FlexMeasures client</a>.</p>
<p>What is the use of a client library for the FlexMeasures platform? Well, FlexMeasures is foremost a web server ― it calculates optimal schedules for flexible energy assets in the cloud, according to price, CO2 output or other constraints. Its API is <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">well-documented</a>. Even though APIs are one of the web architecture's shining beacons, it's not really convenient for developers to use them directly. That's where developer-friendly tooling, like client libraries, come in!</p>
<p>The FlexMeasures client wraps the most important interactions you need to add if you interact with FlexMeasures. For example, if you are connecting a local energy management system (EMS) to be optimized via FlexMeasures, you would need authentication, data I/O and the triggering of new computations. With the client, these functionalities are now as easy to use as calling a function. For instance, here we authorize to a FlexMeasures server, request a schedule for a battery charging sensor and retrieve it (once it's computed):</p>
<pre><code>import asyncio

from flexmeasures_client.client import FlexMeasuresClient

EMAIL = "admin@admin.nl"
PASSWORD = "admin"

async def my_script():
    schedule = await flexmeasures_client.trigger_and_get_schedule(
        sensor_id=1,
        start="2023-06-18T10:00:00+00:00",
        duration="PT45M",
        soc_unit="MWh",
        soc_at_start=50,
        soc_targets=[
            {
                "value": 100,
                "datetime": "2023-06-20T11:00+02:00",
            }
        ],
        consumption_price_sensor=3,
    )<br>    print(schedule)

client = FlexMeasuresClient(
    email=EMAIL,
    password=PASSWORD,
    host="localhost:5000",
)

asyncio.run(my_script())</code></pre>
<p>The FlexMeasures Client is written in Python, so it's most useful for Python developers. In principle, other languages could follow.</p>
<p>At Seita, we first started using the client in a new service with <a href="https://projecten.topsectorenergie.nl/projecten/turbineketel-nestore-en-seita-ems-voor-het-aardgasvrij-maken-van-wijken-tunes-37596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">smart heat storage control</a> and in <a href="https://v2g-liberty.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our V2G project</a>. The FlexMeasures client will evolve together with the FlexMeasures API. For instance, adding sensors is <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a feature you can expect soon</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, to the most important interactions, we're also adding an S2 layer (<a href="https://flexible-energy.eu/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Energy-Management-Opportunities-for-The-Home.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S2</a> is a new flexible asset protocol, with explicit flexibility expression ability). We'll talk more about S2 in another blog post.</p>
<p>If you're trying out the FlexMeasures Client, we'd love to hear from you. Is it useful? What can be improved? You can add issues on <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Github project page</a>. And of course, stars as well as pull requests are welcome :)</p>

                <p>Version v0.14 of FlexMeasures begins a major upgrade in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reporting capability.</span> Also, this version begins work to support scheduling of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heat storage</span>. Finally, we added a bunch of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">developer support</span> features.</p>
<p><a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-14-0-june-15-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See changelog</a> for a complete list or read on below about the larger new features we added.</p>
<h2>Reporting</h2>
<p>FlexMeasures feeds upon raw measurement data (e.g. solar generation) and data from third parties (e.g. weather forecasts). They come together in the FlexMeasures scheduling algorithms.</p>
<p>However, there are more use cases for enriching these data by combining them:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pre-calculations: E.g. from a tariff and some tax rules we compute the real financial impact of price data.</li>
<li>Post-calculations: To be able to show the customer value, we regularly want to compute things like money or CO2 saved.</li>
</ol>
<p>These calculations can be done with code, but there'll be many repetitions. </p>
<p>We now added an infrastructure that allows us to define computation pipelines (see an example below) and CLI commands for developers to list available reporters and trigger their computations regularly:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass" data-code-marker="+"><span class="pl-c1">flexmeasures show reporters</span></span></code></li>
<li><code><span class="blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass" data-code-marker="+"><span class="pl-c1">flexmeasures add report</span></span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>The reporter classes we are designing are using pandas under the hood and can be sub-classed, allowing us to build new reporters from stable simpler ones, and even pipelines. Remember: <em>re-use is developer power</em>!</p>
<p>We believe this infrastructure will become very powerful and enable FlexMeasures hosters and plugin developers to implement exciting new features.</p>
<p>So here is a glimpse into a reporter we made - it is based on the <code>AggregatorReporter</code> (which is for the combination of any two sensors).</p>
<p>This simplified example reporter basically calculates <code>pv - consumption</code> at grid connection point. This tells us how much solar power we fed back to the grid (positive values) and/or the amount of grid power within the overall consumption which did not come from local solar panels (negative values).</p>
<p>First, this is the configuration of how the computation works:</p>
<pre class="notranslate">    {<br>        "method" : "sum",<br>        "weights" : {<br>            "pv" : 1.0,<br>            "consumption" : -1.0<br>        }<br>    }</pre>
<p>Second, this parameterizes the computation (fro which sensors does data come from, which range &amp; where does it go):</p>
<pre><code>    {</code><br><code>        "input": [</code><br><code>            {</code><br><code>                "name" : "pv",</code><br><code>                "sensor": 1,</code><br><code>                "source" : 1,</code><br><code>            },</code><br><code>            {</code><br><code>                "name" : "consumption",</code><br><code>                "sensor": 1,</code><br><code>                "source" : 2,</code><br><code>            }</code><br><code>        ],</code><br><code>        "output": [</code><br><code>            {</code><br><code>                "sensor": 3,</code><br><code>            }</code><br><code>        ],</code><br><code>        "start" : "2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",</code><br><code>        "end" : "2023-01-03T00:00:00+00:00",</code><br><code>    }</code><br><br></pre>
<p>Much more elaborate reporters are possible to be done this way, and we will showcase more later. </p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">641</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">659</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">712</a> and <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/686" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">686</a>. </p>
<p>P.S. We are not done. You are invited to follow along in <a href="https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/discussions/662">the current discussion</a>, where you'll find new ideas like the <code class="notranslate">EnergyBillReporter</code>or the <code>CO2Reporter</code>. We might even support YAML for even higher readability!</p>
<h2>Working on heat scheduling: storage efficiency</h2>
<p>Optimizing heat storage is our next big goal, after our work towards batteries. </p>
<p>We have decided to extend the in-built storage scheduling algorithm towards this goal. There might be other approaches for solving some complex heat storage configurations with custom advanced algorithms, but we believe that a majority of cases can be solved in-built.</p>
<p>The first action was to support the buffer-like behavior of heat storage, namely that energy (heat) is being lost over time. This lead to the new parameter <code>storage-efficiency</code>, which is now part of the <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/notation.html#flex-model">flex model</a>. So now we can express that a hot water storage tank will lose around 1% of the stored heat per day. This will be reflected in what the scheduler finds to be optimal.</p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/679">679</a>.</p>
<h2>Developer support: docs, packaging</h2>
<p>We extended the core team that works on FlexMeasures, and that is always an opportunity to spot problems in the support for developers. We added two main improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better developer docs, making it easier to install FlexMeasures and understand what it's doing (Pull Requests <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/664">664</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/665">665</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/676">676</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/687">687</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/698">698</a>)</li>
<li>Packaging improvements, making it easier to use FlexMeasures in deployments (Pull Requests: <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/670">670</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/671">671</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>API sunsetting</h2>
<p>Finally, as <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/note-on-datamodel-transition.html#note-on-datamodel-transition">our long journey to a more flexible datamodel</a> is coming close to completion, we are sunsetting (as we pre-announced in version 0.12) API versions below 3. Please help your users upgrade to API version 3 before you use FlexMeasures v0.14!</p>
<p>While version 0.13 still allowed hosts to get the sunset endpoints back if needed, we now have sunsetted them and they return HTTP status code 410 by default.</p>
<p>We compiled <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/introduction.html#deprecation-and-sunset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some helpful information for FlexMeasures hosts </a>to manage this transition well.  </p>
<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href="http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/667">667</a>.</p>

By prescribed "shock therapy" :)<br><br>FlexMeasures is already a few years in development, and therefore we are running into issues of longer-term support while innovation is still ongoing. As <a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/note-on-datamodel-transition.html#note-on-datamodel-transition">we have refactored the data model</a>, we also need to move forward with the API and stop supporting older versions.<br>For us as a team, this was an opportunity to adopt proper customer/user support, learning from other professionals who support APIs for the long run. This benefits hosters of FlexMeasures as well as our users.<br><br>Often, API endpoints change or are put out of use (becoming legacy part of the software, eventually not served anymore). However, users currently rely on them. And they hate upgrading. They might not all jump to upgrading their own systems, even if you suggest in time that they should. Why act now, right? Maybe tomorrow! This is a major problem for SaaS providers, who need to innovate and move on.<br><br>In FlexMeasures (v0.14, see <a href="https://github.com/flexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/651">PR 651</a>), we adopted an industry standard called <a href="https://design.oftrust.net/api-migration-policies/blackout-testing">"Blackout Testing"</a>. This tool lets your users experience in a short &amp; planned "shock therapy" if they need to act.<br><br>Here is the usual how it fits into your process: First comes deprecation (API is now legacy code), then sunset (API stops being served). Both of these are pre-announced with clear dates. Both also give the using systems automated signals: HTTP headers label the stage implicitly (deprecation or sunset), and HTTP status codes do that explicitly (e.g. moving from 200 OK to 410 Gone and finally 404 NotFound).<br><br>In short, a blackout test would temporarily simulate the removal (return 410 instead of 200) for a pre-announced short while, maybe an hour. <br><br>That should really get everyone's attention :)<br><br>If you are hosting FlexMeasures, then from version 0.14 on, a blackout test can be activated by changing a simple setting (<a href="https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#flexmeasures-api-sunset-active">FLEXMEASURES_API_SUNSET_ACTIVE</a>).<br><br>If you are a user connected to a FlexMeasures server, this simply means you will be served better. Fewer surprises, still innovation!</span></span></p>
