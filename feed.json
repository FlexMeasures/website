If the data has low quality, so will your schedules. We saw in projects how true this is, and wanted to show ourselves and customers quickly what actually is stored in a sensor.</p>\n<p>We made two crucial additions to the sensor page in FlexMeasures.<br><br>First, we now summarise what the sensor is about (sensor properties), and what data you find (statistics):</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/Sensor-properties-stats.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"350\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Sensor-properties-stats-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Sensor-properties-stats-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Sensor-properties-stats-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Sensor-properties-stats-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Sensor-properties-stats-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Sensor-properties-stats-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>Because on any sensor, we store data from different sources, the statistics are available per source!</p>\n<p>Second, we added a histogram. Sometimes, that is the best way to understand what values you can find in general:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/histogram-visualisation.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"311\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/histogram-visualisation-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/histogram-visualisation-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/histogram-visualisation-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/histogram-visualisation-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/histogram-visualisation-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/histogram-visualisation-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>We already had two visualizations - bar chart and heat map. With this third one, it was time to make the \"Select Chart\" option more prominent (it moved out of the daterange selector).</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1115\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1115</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1116\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1116</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1143\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1143</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1148\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1148</a>.</p>\n<h2>White-labelling</h2>\n<p>We have partners who want to present schedules and reports in FlexMeasures' UI, even if we are hosting FlexMeasures for them. They would love to brand the UI in their colors and logo.</p>\n<p>For this, we added the ability to set primary and secondary colors for each account, as well as a logo URL. Here is a simple (not necessarily beautiful) impression of how FlexMeasures' UI will adapt:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/1920-1080-max.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"107\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/1920-1080-max-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/1920-1080-max-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/1920-1080-max-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/1920-1080-max-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/1920-1080-max-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/1920-1080-max-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>This also brings the ability to edit account settings (like the name).</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1137\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1137</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1145\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1145</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1152</a>.</p>\n<h2>More expressive flex-context and flex-model</h2>\n<p>Within FlexMeasures, the <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/scheduling.html#the-flex-context\">flex-context</a> is crucial: it tells us site-relevant parameters such as pricing and grid capacity limits. The flex-model is evenly important: it tells us about the situation on the ground (e.g. current state of charge, limits to it, set points, ...).</p>\n<p>Expressing these is thus a regular task when modelling a site in FlexMeasures and asking it for schedules. That should be developer-friendly and powerful. E.g. a site constraint can be a static kW value, but also point to a sensor, where the different capacities per time of day are recorded.</p>\n<p>In v0.23, we made substantial progress on both goals.</p>\n<p>We merged existing approaches in a single schema, <code class=\"notranslate\">VariableQuantityField</code> (we also made sure we remain backwards-compatible for a while).</p>\n<p>Now, across all of flex-context and flex-model, there are different ways to tell FlexMeasures about the optimization problem:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>As a constant quantity, such as:\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\">\n<pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">\"10 kW\"\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"zeroclipboard-container position-absolute right-0 top-0\">Note that the unit is part of the message. This is the most direct &amp; easy way.<br><br></div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>As a time series, such as:\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\">\n<pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">[\n    {\n        \"value\": 51,\n        \"start\": \"2024-02-04T10:35:00+01:00\",\n        \"end\": \"2024-02-05T04:25:00+01:00\"\n    }\n]\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"zeroclipboard-container position-absolute right-0 top-0\">This is making it easy to describe temporary blocks, e.g. a few hours where the state of charge should not go below a certain value.Â <br>(NB this example assumes the unit is specified via a separate field).<br><br></div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>As a sensor, such as:\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\">\n<pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">{\n    \"sensor\": 101\n}</code><code class=\"notranslate\"></code></pre>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>In the last example, the data's meta information (such as units) is stored in the sensor objects, and the data is looked up via the sensor table. This is best for highly dynamic data, e.g. prices loaded by a third-party API.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1127\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1127</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1138</a>.</p>\n<p>One more thing in this domain: We can also now express prices as fixed quantities - they were always modelled as series before. Sometimes that is what is needed to test a control strategy. See Pull Request <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/1028\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1028</a>.</p>\n<h2>Faster asset &amp; account page</h2>\n<p>When a lot of accounts and assets are added, we noticed that FlexMeasures took too ling for admins to load the complete lists. We addressed some speed bumps and also added pagination in the asset API and UI, so that the user experience improves.</p>\n<p>See Pull Request <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">988</a>.</p>\n<h2>Adding titles to graphs</h2>\n<p>The graphs on the asset page are the go-to place for watching schedules next to the underlying data. Basically, there we find the data dashboard in FlexMeasures. <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/views/asset-data.html#the-asset-page-as-data-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The sensor_to_show attribute</a> which directs the setup of this dashbaord became more powerful.Â </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"540\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>The image above now not only shows the plots (with one or two sensor each), but has titles for two plots, and this is the configuration for that:<br><br><code>\"sensors_to_show\":[</code><br><code>Â  Â  {\"title\": \"Prices\", \"sensors\":[58, 70]},</code><br><code>Â  Â  16,</code><br><code>Â  Â  {\"title\": \"Battery activity\", \"sensors\": [5, 4]},</code><br><code>Â  Â  15</code><br><code>]</code></p>\n<p>See Pull Request <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/1125\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1125</a>.</p>",

Which sounds boring, but this is where we believe we can show actual dedication to long-time support.Â </p>\n<p>See Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1058\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1058</a>, plus some follow-up PRs for fixes.</p>\n<h2>Asset audit log</h2>\n<p>In version 0.21 we introduced audit logs for users and accounts, so servicing them gets more support (e.g. to track when somebody reset a password). We also added audit log support to assets. This will for instance track when changes were made to an asset.</p>\n<p>This can be handy for instance in combination with flex-context changes like discussed above.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/41/screenshot-auditlog.PNG\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"161\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/41/responsive/screenshot-auditlog-xs.PNG 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/41/responsive/screenshot-auditlog-sm.PNG 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/41/responsive/screenshot-auditlog-md.PNG 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/41/responsive/screenshot-auditlog-lg.PNG 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/41/responsive/screenshot-auditlog-xl.PNG 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/41/responsive/screenshot-auditlog-2xl.PNG 1600w\"></figure>\n<br>See Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1072\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1072</a><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">.</span></div>\n<h2>Three new contributors</h2>\n<p>This release has a record number of first-time contributors :)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/rhpijnacker/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/rhpijnacker\">@rhpijnacker</a> made their first contribution in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"2283970990\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/1057\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1057/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1057\">#1057</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/brownlenox/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/brownlenox\">@brownlenox</a> made their first contribution in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"2287669623\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/1058\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1058/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1058\">#1058</a></li>\n<li><a class=\"user-mention notranslate\" data-hovercard-type=\"user\" data-hovercard-url=\"/users/BelhsanHmida/hovercard\" data-octo-click=\"hovercard-link-click\" data-octo-dimensions=\"link_type:self\" href=\"https://github.com/BelhsanHmida\">@BelhsanHmida</a> made their first contribution in <a class=\"issue-link js-issue-link\" data-error-text=\"Failed to load title\" data-id=\"2359256218\" data-permission-text=\"Title is private\" data-url=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/1099\" data-hovercard-type=\"pull_request\" data-hovercard-url=\"/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1099/hovercard\" href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1099\">#1099</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>",

We found two issues and addressed both, which has led to a major speed improvement. Loading charts now feels more natural.</p>\n<p>The improvements actually happened in the data model library timely-beliefs at <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/timely-beliefs/2.1.0/\">version 2.1.0</a>, see PRs <a href=\"https://github.com/SeitaBV/timely-beliefs/pull/166\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/SeitaBV/timely-beliefs/pull/167\">here</a>.

Sometimes you need some powerful tooling to move things.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We introduce a new command to transfer the ownership of an asset and its children to a different account. Example:Â \n<pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">flexmeasures edit transfer-ownership --asset 1 --account 2</code></pre>\nÂ See Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/983\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">983</a>.</li>\n<li>And it is now simple to delete time series data for an entire site (i.e. with child assets) while keeping its structure, including asset and sensor IDs, intact.

See Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/985\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">985</a><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">.Â </span><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Here is an example:</span>\n<pre class=\"notranslate\">{\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"flex-context\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"site-power-capacity\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>500 kVA<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>,\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"site-consumption-capacity\"</span>: {<span class=\"pl-ent\">\"sensor\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">8</span>},\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"site-production-capacity\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>400 kW<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>,\n    }\n}</pre>\n</li>\n<li>We added the possibility to define SOC (State of Charge) Targets, SOC Maxima and SOC Minima as sensors. For example: <code><span class=\"blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass \" data-code-marker=\"+\"><span class=\"pl-s\">\"soc-minima\": {\"sensor\" : 300}</span></span></code>Â The existing way of defining those (within API calls) is still supported.<br>Why is this useful? Well, these flex-model fields are quite powerful in defining the storage boundaries within which FlexMeasures shall compute the best schedules. Ans these storage boundaries usually come from the user's environment, e.g. as targets for EVs to be charged, comfort-optimized settings for heating or from production planning in an industry setting. Thus, this data is important enough to be stored in its own sensor â then it can easily be updated from a different data source (e.g. EV logistics system) and be displayed on its own. We believe this makes for a more powerful FlexMeasures :)Â <br>See Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/996\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">996</a><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<p>As we mentioned, there were several smaller but crucial improvements. Some highlights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The unit of non-schedulable (inflexible) sensors had to be MW. Now it can be any power unit, e.g. kW, kWh or MWh, which ever you represent it as. FlexMeasures converts the data when reading it from the database and feeding it to the scheduler. See Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1007\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1007</a>.Â </li>\n<li>FlexMeasures can now be run on MacOS. There were some package installation troubles. This might be quite crucial for developers on MacOS (although they could have used docker compose). See Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1000\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1000</a>.Â </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>",

But until we get there, we made it easier to navigate the structure.</p>\n<p>(Note: We actually started work on this in v0.18, but now we have a more complete picture)</p>\n<p>First, we introduced a breadcrump-bar above the asset and sensor pages. This example has the account, the asset and the currently shown sensor:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/breadcrump-example.png\" alt=\"Breadcrumps bar in FlexMeasures\" width=\"500\" height=\"172\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/breadcrump-example-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/breadcrump-example-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/breadcrump-example-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/breadcrump-example-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/breadcrump-example-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/breadcrump-example-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Second, we added a drop-down on the last breadcrump, should there be a lot of child assets. Highly useful for navigating charging hubs:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"456\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/304267715-b41c0d61-b150-4e26-89c2-0fc46bce91ed-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Third, we added a list of child assets to each asset page:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1105\" height=\"700\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/37/responsive/301311090-d2dcf9e0-f44e-4291-8b30-f9c8f9809517-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/930\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">930</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/967\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">967</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/977\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">977</a>.</p>\n<p>We believe this is useful for everyone, even if your site is small and you optimize only one asset, but you still have other (inflexible) ones.</p>\n<p>However, the next steps will be to make sure the in-built schedulers can be told to optimise an asset structure with multiple flexible assets, like a charging hub.

            "content_html": "<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">\n<p>Version v0.18 of FlexMeasures advances the modeling of the flex optimization problem, adding more detail. If we have knowledge about future conditions and underlying physics, our optimization gets better when we put that to use!</p>\n<p>We also improved navigation in the UI, which is really handy for more complex asset structures.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-18-0-december-21-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See the changelog</a> for a complete list. Read on below about the larger new features we added.</p>\n<h2>Future knowledge in scheduling</h2>\n<p>FlexMeasures lets you describe the underlying flexibility problem, so that the internal scheduler knows within what limits to work to find the best solution for the upcoming hours. Earlier, we introduced two data specifications for this, the <code>flex-model</code> (what are the limits and goal around this asset, e.g. maximal state of charge?) and the <code>flex-context</code> (what is also relevant, e.g. prices?). We wrote <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/v2g.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a tutorial with nice examples</a> around the V2G use case.</p>\n<p>Now, we have enhanced the flex-model with three new (or more nuanced) types of information, which lets FlexMeasures handle a wider range of modern energy flexibility problems. We also let them be sensors, instead of just one constant value. But more about that later, first let me introduce the new kinds of flex-model information:</p>\n<h3>External in- and output for storage</h3>\n<p>We can model storage assets which only serve the flexibility of the main system, e.g. a battery which only exists to simply buffer solar energy for self-consumption at some later time. The battery has no strict dependencies outside of our energy flexibility asset model.</p>\n<p>But often, storage (also) serves an external and crucial purpose. A good example is a hot water tank. Comfort of the home occupants is the main goal â consuming energy to create heat at the best time is also important, but secondary.</p>\n<p>Thus, the expected extraction of energy (as heat) from the storage is an important input to the modeling problem â it will form a constraint. In this example, the input of energy (as electricity) is dynamic, and can be timed optimally to lower the energy costs and/pr CO2.</p>\n<p>To handle these situations optimally, we introduced fields in the flex model to represent an expected extraction of stored energy (e.g. when we know the occupants are at home), or even addition (e.g. when an industrial process will add heat) â we called them <span class=\"blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass \" data-code-marker=\"+\"><code><span class=\"pl-c1\">soc-usage</span></code> and <span class=\"pl-c1\"><code><span class=\"pl-token\">soc</span>-gain</code><span class=\"pl-token\">. This makes the flex model much more expressive. Obviously, these fields only work with the <code>StorageScheduler</code>.</span></span></span></p>\n<h3>Energy conversion efficiency</h3>\n<div>We noticed that the efficiency of turning electricity into usable energy is a crucial modelling factor, especially when modeling smart heating problems.Â <br>in earlier version, we supported conversion losses with a constant <span class=\"blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass \" data-code-marker=\"+\"><span class=\"pl-en\"><span class=\"pl-s\"><code>roundtrip-efficiency</code></span></span></span> value. Used as a percentage, this works well enough for batteries or even for heat losses that happen in an inverter.</div>\n<div>Â </div>\n<div>As an example where that breaks down, consider that the COP of Heat Pumps typically depends strongly on the outside temperature. To be able to model this more precisely within the optimization problem (losses are a crucial detail here), you can now use <span class=\"blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass \" data-code-marker=\"+\"><span class=\"pl-en\"><span class=\"pl-s\"><code>charging-efficiency</code> and <code>discharging-efficiency</code> separately, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">and</span> they can be time series (more about that below). The latter feature is what you need if the conditions for energy conversion efficiency are not constant, like outside temperature.</span></span></span></div>\n<h3>Consumption and production capacities</h3>\n<p>Until now, only one kind of maximal capacity was possible (for example, to describe a limit to the grid connection). We used the field <code>power-capacity</code>, and it had to have <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">one</span> constant value, e.g. 25 kW.</p>\n</div>\n<div><br>We made this more expressive. Look at the example below.Â </div>\n<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">\n<pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">{\n    \"flex-model\": {\n        \"consumption-capacity\": \"25 kW\",\n        \"production-capacity\": {\"sensor\": 51}\n    }\n}</code></pre>\nWe can now differentiate between limits on production and consumption. <code>power-capacity</code>still works â if it is given, it would serve as a limit on the other two.</div>\n<div>Â </div>\n<h3>Varying values over time!</h3>\n<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">Look at the above example for <code>production-capacity</code> again. This is not a constant value, but references a sensor. The added value here is that the allowed production capacity can vary over time.</div>\n<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">This might soon be relevant in practice, as DSOs offer network contracts in which businesses have a varying grid connection capacity! (next to offering, they might even force businesses to use them, if grid congestion is high).</div>\n<div>Â </div>\n<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">But also for the two other examples we discussed above (where values can also be a constant number or a sensor from now on), a varying series of values might help you model reality more closely.</div>\n<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">906,</a> <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/933\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">933</a>Â and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/897\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">897</a>.Â </p>\n<h2>UI navigation of complex sites</h2>\n<p>Behind the scenes, we work with more complex asset structures. We have introduced the capability of assets being the child of another asset. Now, tree-like structures can be built (where sensors are the leaves, usually) in order to model whole sites or different scenarios for simulation projects.</p>\n<p>This also calls for efforts to navigate this structures. We are looking to develop a visual representation of this tree-structure. But until we get there, we made it easier to navigate the structure.</p>\n<p>First, we introduced a breadcrump-bar above the asset and sensor pages. This example has the account, the asset and the currently shown sensor:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/breadcrump-example.png\" alt=\"Breadcrumps bar in FlexMeasures\" width=\"500\" height=\"172\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Second, we made lists of assets and sensors easy to click. The whole row will now react to one simple click and take you where you want to go!</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/930\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">930</a>Â and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/923\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">923</a>.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<p>Â </p>\n</div>",

And the ESCo should be able to consult their clients, for instance for servicing questions and problems. And this means to see their data.</p>\n<p>We now enabled that. This unlocks using FlexMeasures in more powerful hosting scenarios.</p>\n<p>Each account can now have a consultant account linked. Users in that account who have the role <code>consultant</code> will now be able to see the client's asset and data. In the UI, each client's account page shows who their consultant is, and consultants will see who their client accounts are and can access them from there. The API also allows read access for consultants.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/877\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">877</a>Â and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/892\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">892</a>.Â </p>\n<p>Future work might add the ability to also add or edit assets and sensors.</p>\n<h2>Fallback schedulers<code></code></h2>\n<p>Sometimes a schedule might not be feasible. This happens for example when a strict state-of-charge target for a storage was set, but can't be reached in time. In FlexMeasures, a fallback scheduler can then try to reach as close to that target as possible. But it's crucial to deal with this situation and visualize it.</p>\n<p>We enabled for FlexMasures hosts that they separate background jobs in this case (e.g. one run by <code>StorageScheduler</code> and one run by <code>FallbackStorageScheduler</code>). By giving them distinct data sources, it can also be visualized better in the UI that the schedules are somewhat different (a \"perfect\" one and a \"good enough\" one).</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/846\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">846</a>, Â <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/841\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">841</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">888</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/891\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">891</a>.</p>\n<h2>New favicon: <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/35/favicon.ico\" alt=\"\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\"></figure></h2>\n<p>We noticed that the FlexMeasures UI was not using a favicon which represents its logo (within LF Energy).

For instance, we might want to send a chart to a client (in lieu of them having an account set up and us sending a link to the chart). Or we are supposed to create a Word document.</p>\n<p>The new command <code class=\"notranslate\">flexmeasures show chart</code> can export sensor and asset charts.Â <br>Here is an example:</p>\n<p><code>flexmeasures show chart --start 2023-08-15T00:00:00+02:00 --end 2023-08-16T00:00:00+02:00 --asset 1 --sensor 14 --sensor 15 --filename 'chart-$now-$entity_type-$id.png'</code></p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/833\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">833</a>.</p>\n<h2>Capacity limits as a field in the flex context</h2>\n<p>The limit to a storage device or the grid connection are crucial information for FlexMeasures' algorithm. The way this could be encoded before was not very user-friendly (as asset or sensor attribute). We have now added the fields <code class=\"notranslate\">storage_power_capacity_in_mw</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">ems_power_capacity_in_mw</code>, respectively, so that the flex model can encode this explicitly (the flex model can be sent to the API when triggering schedules and soon be stored on the asset itself).</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/850\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">850</a>.</p>\n</div>",
