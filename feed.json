You can see it as a data-driven decision-support system for energy flexibility.</div>\n<div>The question FlexMeasures helps to solves is: What are the best times to run my flexible assets? For instance, when to (dis)charge my EV batteries? When should we run our heat pumps to warm up the office?</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Here is the simple version ― sensor data goes in, optimized schedules come out:</div>\n<h2><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/simple-flexEMS-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/responsive/simple-flexEMS-2-xs.png 300w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/responsive/simple-flexEMS-2-sm.png 480w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/responsive/simple-flexEMS-2-md.png 768w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/responsive/simple-flexEMS-2-lg.png 1024w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/responsive/simple-flexEMS-2-xl.png 1360w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/3/responsive/simple-flexEMS-2-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"191\"></figure>Why do you do this?</h2>\n<div> </div>\n<div>See <a href=\"https://www.seita.nl/why\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this mission statement</a> (from the original creators): We have to go green. Flexible demand has to be matched with green energy. Open innovation can get us to the speed we need for the global transition.</div>\n<h2>How does FlexMeasures add value?</h2>\n<div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>In the end, energy flexibility is about saving energy costs and CO₂. This is why we do this in the first place.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Taking a more closer look, we believe that lowering the cost of software development can help a big deal. More organisations will be willing to make use of energy flexibility, if the initial costs of such smart systems are low enough. And software development (not even the machine learning parts) makes up a bigger part of the costs than people realize.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>We want developers to love building novel apps and services with FlexMeasures, and for them to focus on the context-specific dimensions: The configuration of how they want FlexMeasures to optimize outcomes, and how this gets presented to users/operators.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Let's take a closer look at FlexMeasures' three core value drivers:</span>\n<div><br>\n<div>1. Real-time data intelligence and integration, with advice for the rest of the day. For example, forecasts and schedules are made available via API.</div>\n<div>2. Energy sensor and environment data have multiple sources and their forecasts are uncertain. FlexMeasures uses <a href=\"https://github.com/SeitaBV/timely-beliefs)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the timely-beliefs library</a> to model this well.</div>\n<div>3. Developer support ― building customer-facing apps &amp; services is where energy flexibility hits the road. FlexMeasures reduces developer workload with a well-documented API, data visualization and multi-tenancy, and it supports plugins to customize and extend the platform to your needs.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Here is a more complete picture of how FlexMeasures fits into an advanced and configurable data-schedules loop:</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/overview-flexEMS.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/responsive/overview-flexEMS-xs.png 300w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/responsive/overview-flexEMS-sm.png 480w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/responsive/overview-flexEMS-md.png 768w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/responsive/overview-flexEMS-lg.png 1024w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/responsive/overview-flexEMS-xl.png 1360w ,file:///home/nicolas/Seitacloud/Internal/FlexMeasures/Website/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/input/media/posts/6/responsive/overview-flexEMS-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"457\"></figure></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1g2pagetfj\">Why is FlexMeasures open source, and why is it part of the Linux Energy Foundation?</h2>\n<p>We saw two reasons to open source the code of FlexMeasures:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Nowadays, open source is a great fit for the speed of innovation which we need, and also the spread of innovation. The energy transition has to go blazingly fast, everywhere. These days, open source projects are often able to innovate faster than closed source counterparts (once they've picked up momentum).</li>\n<li>From our many years of experience in designing smart energy solutions, we've come to realize that energy solutions often have multiple stakeholders (e.g. asset owner, user, network operator, energy service company). The transparency offered by open source, and the lack of lock-in, makes collaboration easier and agreements faster.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.lfenergy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Linux Energy Foundation</a> is a great place for the FlexMeasures project to be part of the growing community of people who understand the above reasoning.open source </p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1g2pagetfk\">How do I use FlexMeasures / get started?</h2>\n<p>We make FlexMeasures, so that developers are as productive with energy optimization as possible. As we are developers ourselves, we know that it takes a couple smaller steps to engage with new technology.</p>\n<p>Your journey, from dipping your toes in the water towards being a happy FlexMeasures power user, could look like this:</p>\n<ol class=\"arabic simple\">\n<li>\n<p>Quickstart ― Find an optimized schedule for your flexible asset, like a battery, with standard FlexMeasures tooling. This is basically what the from-scratch tutorial above does. All you need are 10 minutes and a CSV file with prices to optimise against.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Automate ― get the prices from an open API, for instance <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://transparency.entsoe.eu/\">ENTSO-E</a> (using a plugin like <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-entsoe\">flexmeasures-entsoe</a>), and run the scheduler regularly in a cron job.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Integrate ― Load the schedules via FlexMeasures’ API, so you can directly control your assets and/or show them within your own front-end.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Customize ― Load other data (e.g. your solar production or weather forecasts via <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-openweathermap/\">flexmeasures-openweathermap</a>. Adapt the algorithms, e.g. do your own forecasting or tweak the standard scheduling algorithm so it optimizes what you care about. Or write a plugin for accessing a new kind of market. The opportunities are endless!</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div> </div>\n<div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1g2pagetfl\">Can you give some real-world examples where FlexMeasures is used today?</h2>\n<p>FlexMeasures is being used in a few industry projects (water sanitation, sludge burning), where we for instance help to run centrifuges to run during the greenest hours of the day.</p>\n<p>It is also used in projects with smaller assets, around the smart home setting (<a href=\"https://positive-design.nl/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a vehicle-to-grid living lab</a> and battery optimization). Here, FlexMeasures helps to buy cheap, and sell at high prices, for an optimal financial result.</p>\n<p>Much work currently goes into the integration of heat pumps.</p>\n<p>Of course, we might be missing some use cases. <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.io/get-in-touch/\">We'd love to hear from you</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1g2pagetfm\">How can FlexMeasures become a puzzle piece in large-scale solutions?</h2>\n<p>The \"data-driven\" part is where we start! From our experience, data pipelines and dashboarding around energy-consuming assets now often exists.</p>\n<p>FlexMeasures works well as the single EMS, but also as an added smart back-end. Integrating the data often means to feed only the relevant parts to FlexMeasures (only relevant sensors, only the resolution needed for decision-making in schedules, e.g. 5 minutes).</p>\n<p>Once the right algorithms are connected, FlexMeasures provides optimized schedules via API. Its UI also shows sensor data and schedules and provides the ability for users/operators to annotate them.</p>\n<p>The schedules an thus be integrated into larger solutions, into user-facing apps etc. Just as the context requires.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

This lets them interact quicker and more direct with a software platform. With the 0.9.0 release, FlexMeasures adds several commands to work with an instance.</p>\n<p>To have them available is especially useful when onboarding a new account or new assets (which is the time when the most developer attention is spent in a FlexMeasures project, or any enterprise software project). These commands are also useful to automate tasks like data ingestion or scheduling.</p>\n<p>Here is  a list of new commands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Showing data: <code>flexmeasures show accounts</code>, <code>flexmeasures show account</code>, <code>flexmeasures show roles</code>, <code>flexmeasures show asset-types</code>, <code>flexmeasures show asset</code>, <code>flexmeasures show data-sources</code>, and <code>flexmeasures show beliefs</code></li>\n<li>Resample sensor data to a different resolution: <code>flexmeasures db-ops resample-data</code></li>\n<li>Create a new schedule for a given power sensor: <code>flexmeasures add schedule</code></li>\n<li>Edit/add an attribute on an asset or sensor: <code>flexmeasures edit attribute</code></li>\n<li>Add a toy account with a battery and a market for trying FlexMeasures out quickly: <code>flexmeasures add toy-account</code></li>\n<li>Deleting data: <code> flexmeasures delete unchanged-beliefs</code>, <code>flexmeasures delete nan-beliefs</code>, <code>flexmeasures delete sensor</code>, <code>flexmeasures delete asset</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see all commands in <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/commands.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FlexMeasures' CLI documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/328\">328</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/341\">341</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/337\">337</a> , <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/291\">339</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/343\">343</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/360\">360,</a> <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/368\">368</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/395\">395</a>.</p>\n<h2>Unit conversion</h2>\n<p>Units are a crucial topic in time series data. Only if you get them right, will your data also be correct (and you avoid the risk of incorrect data / lengthy debugging periods). Especially if you have to transform data. One example is of course power to energy, e.g. kW to kWh. There is many more examples.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/rounding.png\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"XKCD on unit conversion\" width=\"420\" height=\"489\">\n<figcaption >The relevant XKCD cartoon</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>We use the excellent <a href=\"https://pint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pint library</a> to help us with that. With version 0.9.0,  FlexMeasures will now convert incoming data, if it has a different source unit than the required sensor unit.</p>\n<p>For instance, if the incoming data is kWh, and we know the sensor should store kW, and we also know the sensor's time resolution (e.g. it sends data once per 5 minutes), then we can store kWh data correctly as kW data.</p>\n<p>Another great example are percentages. We might receive data in percentages, but it should be permille.</p>\n<p>This is now done automatically in both the CLI (<code>flexmeasures add beliefs</code>) and the API (<code>POST /sensorData</code>) when adding data.</p>\n<p>This work was done in <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/341\">Pull Request 341</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/359\">Pull Request 359</a>.</p>\n<h2>Toy tutorial</h2>\n<p>We want many organisations to use FlexMeasures and drastically reduce the development time they need to get an energy flexibility app or service up and running. For this, we were missing a tutorial to show from scratch how FlexMeasures can be useful within minutes.</p>\n<p>We now have one where you install FlexMeasures and within a couple minutes you are optimizing the charging schedule of a battery. See it in action here.</p>\n<p>This work was done in <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/381\">Pull Request 381</a>.</p>\n<h2> </h2>\n<p> </p>",

For instance, to maximise self-consumption of your solar panels.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/OpenWeather-Logo.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/OpenWeather-Logo-xs.jpg 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/OpenWeather-Logo-sm.jpg 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/OpenWeather-Logo-md.jpg 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/OpenWeather-Logo-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/OpenWeather-Logo-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/OpenWeather-Logo-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"OpenWeatherMap  Logo\" width=\"432\" height=\"149\"></figure>\n<p>The source code of the plugin is <a href=\"https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-openweathermap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. It adds two CLI commands, one for registering weather sensors on desired locations, one for calling the API and gathering the forecasts for the upcoming hours.</p>\n<h3>ENTSO-E</h3>\n<p>Market data is crucial for planning ahead. Two examples we use are day-ahead prices (to optimize energy costs) and production forecasts (to estimate the CO2 content on the grid for the upcoming hours).</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/ENTSO-E_logo_sml.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/ENTSO-E_logo_sml-xs.jpg 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/ENTSO-E_logo_sml-sm.jpg 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/ENTSO-E_logo_sml-md.jpg 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/ENTSO-E_logo_sml-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/ENTSO-E_logo_sml-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/ENTSO-E_logo_sml-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"ENTSO-E logo\" width=\"443\" height=\"120\"></figure>\n<p>ENTSO-E is the association of European TSOs. <a href=\"https://transparency.entsoe.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Their transparency platform</a> publishes different kind of data across European regions. </p>\n<p>The source code of the plugin is <a href=\"https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-entsoe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. It currently supports importing day-ahead prices as well as generation. Based on generation, the CO2 content for the upcoming day can be computed.</p>\n<h3>Z-Info</h3>\n<p>A plugin for importing data from <a href=\"https://www.z-info.nl\" rel=\"nofollow\">Z-Info</a> into FlexMeasures. Z-Info is a sensor data service for the Dutch water industry. The source code is <a href=\"https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-zinfo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/21/responsive/Z-info-FC-RGB-188x300-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"Z-Info Logo\" width=\"188\" height=\"300\"></figure>",

Behind the scenes, a big data model transition is taking form.</p>\n<h2>Better scheduling</h2>\n<p>We work with scheduling of batteries<a href=\"https://seita.nl/project/v2ghome-living-lab/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> in practice</a>, which is a great opportunity to find small and crucial improvements.</p>\n<p>For instance, we were able to improve the stability in edge cases. FlexMeasures also now can take into account the limited round trip efficiency of batteries, as well as asymmetric buy/sell prices.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/291\">291</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/267\">267</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/270\">270</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/300\">300</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/291\">291</a>.</p>\n<h2>Safer data</h2>\n<p>If several accounts (customers) sit in the same FlexMeasures server, it is all the more crucial that only the correctly authorized persons get to see or change data.</p>\n<p>v0.8.0 introduces the ability to protect data within users within one account, building on our multi-tenancy model from <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.io/v060-multi-tenancy-error-monitoring/\">version 0.6.0</a>. This work was done in <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/210\">Pull Request 210</a>.</p>\n<p>When implementing authorization, it's highly important to do that in a developer-friendly way. What we mean with that is developers need to find it straightforward to make the correct decisions of who has permission to create/read/update/delete which data, and which API endpoints require the user to have which permissions.</p>\n<p>In v0.8.0, we implement an authorization model, where the first question is answered in one central place (on the data model) and with high granularity (object-level security). We also offer a new API endpoint decorator (<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">@permission_required_for_context</span></code>), so in-built endpoints, as well as API endpoints in plugins, can be protected easily.</p>\n<p>This work was done in <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/234\">Pull Request 234</a>.</p>\n<h2>Data model transition</h2>\n<p>Behind the curtains, this version makes a huge step from our deprecated data model to a new, more flexible one. We describe this transition in detail <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/note-on-datamodel-transition.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, even with before &amp; after pictures.</p>\n<p>We are left with a few items on our TODO list, but in this version, we made a big effort. We moved a lot of structure over, as well as actual data and some UI (dashboard, assets). We believe that was the hardest part.</p>\n<p>We also took care so existing users feel as little blockage as possible. We wrote extra code so the old data model can still function in the new world, and that data is copied over in the background (don't forget to do the database migration, of course, see changelog).</p>\n<h2> </h2>\n<p> </p>",

Professional packaging, testing &amp; style! </p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/plugins.html\">FlexMeasures plugins</a> are a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">hugely</span> important concept. Writing data integrations for,  and <a href=\"https://seita.nl/services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">services</a> on top of FlexMeasures ― that's done with plugins.  To support getting started with them in the right way, we now provide <a href=\"https://github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures-plugin-template\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a CookieCutter template</a> to get you started in 30 seconds. It also includes a few Blueprint examples and best practices like tests.</p>\n<h2>Python packages</h2>\n<p>Plugins can be complete Python packages now. Python code which can be installed on your system, e.g. with the pip package manager. You could even upload it to the Pypi index :)</p>\n<p>So what is professional about packages? It is more straightforward with a package to add code hygiene, version management and dependencies. You can imagine how much better you'll manage when your plugin can depend on a specific FlexMeasures version and other plugins can depend on yours.</p>\n<p>We envision that a top-level service plugin lists FlexMeasures, as well as one or two data integration plugins. You could install that plugin, and immediately run FlexMeasures and your service runs,</p>\n<p>If you use the packaging option, FlexMeasures still wants you to define the Blueprints for UI, CLI or API functionality at the top-level of the plugin. (If your plugin is just a folder with files, it still should be in the __init__.py file).</p>\n<p>To hit the ground running with the packaging approach,  try the CookieCutter template we mention above, where we give you a full package structure.</p>\n<p>This work was done in <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/182\">Pull Request 182</a>.</p>\n<h2>Test automation support</h2>\n<p>If the plugin is used for serious stuff, its code also should be tested in automated fashion.</p>\n<p>Some tests test an integration of the behavior on top of an actual running app. That's of course a FlexMeasures app. So the plugin tests need to tell FlexMeasures to load the plugin. <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/plugins.html#notes-on-writing-tests-for-your-plugin\">This is now possible</a> easily.</p>\n<p>This work was done in <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/220\">Pull Request 220</a>.</p>\n<h2>Style your plugin</h2>\n<p>We believe that FlexMeasures shines as a backend, with a modern one-page JavaScript/HTML frontend for user-facing apps built on top of it.  That's why we provide a full API.</p>\n<p>However, a real quick way to provide a UI is to use the Jinja2 templating capabilities of  Flask (which FlexMeasures is built on). We do that in pilots when no frontend dev is available.</p>\n<p>Now we made it easier to impose your style on this UI. It's now possible to <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/plugins.html#adding-your-own-stylesheets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">add your custom CSS spreadsheet</a> and <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/plugins.html#using-a-custom-favicon-icon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">also show your own logo</a> for the top left corner.

The two most notable new features are that users and assets now belong to accounts (allowing for multi-tenancy setups), and that it's now possible to monitor for things going wrong (and be able to react in time).</p>\n<h2>Multi-tenancy</h2>\n<p>We envision that there'll be one FlexMeasures server run per ESCO. However, they have multiple customers. Of course, we want to treat them differently in terms of what they see and also silo their data from other customers.</p>\n<p>We updated the data model ― we added an account table, to which users and assets are connected. Accounts can also have roles. We made use of these account roles right away in enabling the UI to show different things to users from different (kind of) accounts, e.g. a different landing page or menu links.</p>\n<p>This work was done in <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/159\">Pull Request 159</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/163\">Pull Request 163</a>.</p>\n<h2>Error monitoring</h2>\n<p>When you run a FlexMeasures server, you want to stay on top of things going wrong. We added two ways of doing that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can connect to Sentry, so that all errors will be sent to your Sentry account. Add the token you got from Sentry in the <em>SENTRY_DNS</em> config setting and you're up and running! See <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/143\">Pull Request 143</a>.</li>\n<li>Another source of crucial errors are things that did not even happen! For instance, a task to import prices from a day-ahead market, which you depend on later for scheduling. We added a new CLI task called <em>flexmeasures monitor tasks, </em>so you can be alerted when tasks have not successfully run at least so-and-so many minutes ago. The alerts will also come in via Sentry, but you can also send them to email addresses with the config setting <em>FLEXMEASURES_MONITORING_MAIL_RECIPIENTS. </em>See <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/146\">Pull Request 146</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For illustration of the latter monitoring, here is one example of how we monitor tasks on a server ― the below is run in a cron script every hour:</p>\n<p><code>flexmeasures monitor tasks --task get_weather_forecasts 60 --task get_recent_meter_data 6  --task import_epex_prices 1440</code></p>\n<p>The first task (get_weather_forecasts) is actually supported within FlexMeasures, while the other two sit in plugins we wrote. </p>\n<h2>Some other notable improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Documented how to use a custom favicon in plugins, see <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/152\">Pull Request 152</a>. </li>\n<li>Analytics view offers grouping of all assets by location, see <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/148\">Pull Request 148</a>.</li>\n<li>Allow plugins to register multiple Flask blueprints, see <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/171\">Pull Request 171</a>.</li>\n</ul>",

Aside from great additions to <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest\">the documentation</a> (tutorials!) and some smaller things, there's new features for customisation of your project and an important switch to how you can retrieve weather forecasts!</p>\n<h2>OpenWeatherMap</h2>\n<p>FlexMeasures has a CLI command to retrieve weather forecasts from a third party. Very handy. We used DarkSky for this, but they got bought by Apple and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/01/dark-sky-android-app-shutdown-august-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">will discontinue their open API in August 2021</a>. So we switched to OpenW<a href=\"https://openweathermap.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"></a>eatherMap. IIf you were using this feature, there is not much you have to do. Create an account there and set ``OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY`` in the FlexMeasures config.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18.4px;\">This work was also done in <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/113\">Pull Request 113</a>.</p>\n<h2>Plugin customisation</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/plugins.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Plugins in FlexMeasures</a> are crucial ― they allow a developer to create a customer-centric FlexMeasures solution. We at Seita are using them extensively now.</p>\n<p>It's important that the developer can control look&amp;feel. So this version of FlexMeasures allows to the URL routes and many smaller details in the UI.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/106\">106</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/123\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">123</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/139\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">139</a>.</p>\n<h2>Entity addressing</h2>\n<p>This one is a deeper technical issue behind the scenes, but crucial for a setting in which FlexMeasures talks to other parties about the same assets, or even multiple FlexMeasures instances do that.</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18.4px;\">Addressing entities (assets) in non-specific ways can lead to confusion and hard-to-detect data integration errors. We started a new entity addressing schema (`fm1`) which identifies any sensor (from assets, weather sensors, markets all the way to actuators we hope to add soon) with only their ID (<a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/introduction.html#connections-and-entity-addresses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">see docs</a>). This prepares for our new data model where this is commonplace (see our log of the previous version 0.4.0).</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 18.4px;\">This work was also done in <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/81\" style=\"border-bottom: 3px solid rgba(var(--yellow), 1);\">Pull Request 81</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>",
