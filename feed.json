We do have a reporting engine, but you have to know it is there (one tutorial does help you use it) and showing that data is your own job.</p>\n<p>Now, we make the first step for such data to step into the light - daily KPIs (e.g. daily energy costs) can be shown above the graphs:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/52/KPIs-full.png\" alt=\"KPIs shown on top of graphs\" width=\"800\" height=\"429\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/52/responsive/KPIs-full-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/52/responsive/KPIs-full-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/52/responsive/KPIs-full-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/52/responsive/KPIs-full-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/52/responsive/KPIs-full-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/52/responsive/KPIs-full-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>This is the way to configure such KPI widgets at the moment:</p>\n<p><code>[</code><br><code>¬† ¬† {\"title\": \"My KPI\", \"sensor\": 2, \"function\": \"sum\"},</code><br><code>¬† ¬† {\"title\": \"Raw Power KPI\", \"sensor\": 3, \"function\": \"sum\"}</code><br><code>]</code></p>\n<p>The function setting can be either \"sum\", \"mean\", \"max\" or \"min\". We are working on a graphical way to set these soon. Until then, see <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/latest/views/asset-data.html#showing-daily-kpis\">this documentation</a> on how to use htis feature.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1608\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1608</a>, ¬†<a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1656\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1656</a> , <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1633\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1633</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1634\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1634</a></p>\n<h2>Faster graphs page</h2>\n<p>The graphs page is very important to check in on a site, especially if it is new.

We already have used FlexMeasures to schedule sites with more than one flexible device (e.g. also EVs), but with one caveat: we scheduled one flexible device after the other (sequentially - we'll add a short explanation below).</p>\n<p>Anyway, we were lacking an endpoint to run one simultaneuous optimization for a combined schedule, and after several preparation steps and testing in the last few months, we added <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/latest/api/v3_0.html#post--api-v3_0-assets-(id)-schedules-trigger\">this one</a>:</p>\n<p><code><span class=\"sig-name descname\"><span class=\"pre\">POST</span> </span><span class=\"sig-name descname\"><span class=\"pre\">/api/v3_0/assets/</span></span><span class=\"sig-paren\">(</span><em class=\"sig-param\"><span class=\"pre\">id</span></em><span class=\"sig-paren\">)</span><span class=\"sig-name descname\"><span class=\"pre\">/schedules/trigger</span></span></code></p>\n<p>\"Trigger FlexMeasures to create a schedule for a collection of flexible and inflexible devices.\"</p>\n<p>Of course, we stay true to the ambition that each device can be steered so that the schedule fits its unique constraints, and thus telling FlexMeasures about the flex-models can look like this:</p>\n<pre id=\"codecell6\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"start\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"2015-06-02T10:00:00+00:00\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"flex-model\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">931</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"soc-at-start\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mf\">12.1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"soc-unit\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"kWh\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"power-capacity\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"25kW\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"consumption-capacity\"</span> <span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nt\">\"sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">42</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"production-capacity\"</span> <span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"30 kW\"</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">932</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"consumption-capacity\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"0 kW\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"production-capacity\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nt\">\"sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">760</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">],</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"flex-context\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"consumption-price-sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">9</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"production-price-sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"inflexible-device-sensors\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">13</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">14</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">15</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"site-power-capacity\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"100kW\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"site-production-capacity\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"80kW\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"site-consumption-capacity\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nt\">\"sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">32</span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span></pre>\n<p>This is for two devices (see the endpoint docs for more explanation of this example). For more flexible devices, the body becomes longer.¬† Luckily, we are also working on letting you specify all flex-model fields on the asset data models (for flex-context, that already is the case).¬†</p>\n<p>We are really happy that this finally is in place. This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1065\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1065</a> , but actually you'll find preparation steps going back more than 6 months.¬†</p>\n<p>Now, how does \"sequential\" scheduling work? After each device we scheduled, we were adding the already scheduled ones to the list of inflexible devices, so the next schedule would take them into account. This approach might scale better with a large number of devices, but we found that the new simultaneous approach also works well with ~100 devices. However, it is still an interesting approach, so the new endpoint offers it, as well (just pass<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">sequential=true</span></code>).</p>\n<h2>Two-factor authentication</h2>\n<p>Cyber-security is more and more crucial when running a serious service - and that is what we aim FlexMeasures to be.</p>\n<p>That means we had to increase the level of security. A lot of that happens in anybody's cloud environment, but FlexMeasures itself needs to also be hardened.¬†</p>\n<p>So version 0.27 adds Two-factor Authentication, the mechanism where only one factor (your password) is not enough to log into the service. In this first implementation, users need a separate token, as well, which is sent to their email address. We can expand this to support QR codes (for security apps) or SMS.</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/Screenshot-from-2025-07-20-17-40-40.png\" alt=\"Second login step if 2FA is enabled - form for the 2nd factor code\" width=\"500\" height=\"528\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-07-20-17-40-40-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-07-20-17-40-40-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-07-20-17-40-40-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-07-20-17-40-40-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-07-20-17-40-40-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-07-20-17-40-40-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >Second login step if 2FA is enabled - form for the 2nd factor code</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>¬†</p>\n<p>TFA is off by default, so anyone hosting FlexMeasures should <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/latest/host/installation.html#two-factor-authentication\">consider turning it on</a>.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1555\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1555</a>,<a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1562\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">¬†1562</a> and<a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1564\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">¬†1564</a>.</p>\n<p>A final note on security in FlexMeasures: we take this seriously on a few fronts: We are upgrading our dependencies with every minor version, we use GitHub's Dependabot and are now starting to scan its code regularly for any potential issues.</p>\n<h2>Upload data</h2>\n<p>To get any data into FlexMeasures, you needed to use the API or CLI. Now there is another way: Sometimes, all you need is to get data from a file into the platform (e.g. to add history for forecasting, or tomorrow's prices). And this is possible now:</p>\n<h2><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/Screenshot-from-2025-07-14-17-57-04.png\" alt=\"Upload form on the sensor page\" width=\"336\" height=\"385\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-07-14-17-57-04-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-07-14-17-57-04-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-07-14-17-57-04-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-07-14-17-57-04-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-07-14-17-57-04-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/50/responsive/Screenshot-from-2025-07-14-17-57-04-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>User editing</h2>\n<p>User editing was possible via the API, but the UI was missing.

Sometimes the perfect solution does not exist. FlexMeasures should still present a schedule that is the best it can do. But which goal/constraint is most important? We are working on letting the user decide.</p>\n<p>Let us consider a simple example: In the V2G Liberty project (which uses FlexMeasures as a scheduling backend), the user can give a minimal charge level, for when they plan longer trips. FlexMeasure should attempt to reach this target, but sometimes the user might have given FlexMeasures too little time to accomplish that.</p>\n<p>Here is a visualization:</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/V2GLiberty-Screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"549\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >The V2GLiberty app, showing FlexMeasures' schedule (orange) and the minimal-charge window (blue)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Here, the minimal charge window cannot be reached, but FlexMeasures will reach the minimal level as early as possible.

The first iteration on this since more than six months cleans the page visually, and separates the rows per data source types.</p>\n<p>Forecasts and schedules for a power sensor are about the future, after all, while the measurements are about the past. Obviously, the traffic light needs to reflect what kind of source the data comes from - we expect forecasts to always be available into the future, while measurements (which are used in forecasts and schedules) are not, but should also not be too old.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/asset-status-source-type.png\" alt=\"Status page, now differentiated by data source type\" width=\"800\" height=\"467\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/asset-status-source-type-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/asset-status-source-type-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/asset-status-source-type-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/asset-status-source-type-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/asset-status-source-type-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/48/responsive/asset-status-source-type-2xl.png 1600w\">\n<figcaption >Status page, now differentiated by data source type</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Next work on the status page will address its speed, which still seems underwhelming if there is much data, and enable to select which sensors should be shown.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1022</a>.</p>\n</div>",

            "content_html": "<p>The energy sector is undergoing a major transformation, with new challenges and opportunities arising from the rise of renewable energy sources and the electrification of everything from heating to transportation. One of the most pressing challenges is managing the increasing demand for electricity while ensuring grid stability and minimizing costs. Additionally, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power makes it difficult to match supply with demand, leading to potential grid imbalances.</p>\n<p>Energy flexibility is a solution to these challenges. It refers to the ability to adjust energy consumption and production in response to changes in supply, demand, or prices. This can be achieved through a variety of technologies and strategies, such as smart appliances, energy storage systems, and demand response programs.</p>\n<p>FlexMeasures is an open source EMS platform for optimizing energy flexibility, built for innovative startups and digitally-enabled energy service companies (ESCOs).</p>\n<p>Think of it as the ‚ÄúLego Mindstorms‚Äù of smart energy planning ‚Äì combining out-of-the-box functionality (like the algorithms but also UIs and APIs) with modularity, so your digital energy service has the ability for smart orchestration of behind-the-meter assets.</p>\n<p>Developed by<a href=\"https://seita.nl/\"> Seita Energy Flexibility</a>, a Dutch-German startup and contributed to <a href=\"https://lfenergy.org/\">LF Energy</a>, FlexMeasures is already being adopted by smart energy startups worldwide. These startups are leveraging its versatile, developer-friendly tools to build impactful solutions for energy planning and optimization, often using FlexMeasures as the basis for their EMS design.</p>\n<p><strong>The Opportunity of Energy Flexibility</strong></p>\n<p>A device is energy-flexible when its consumption can be shifted in time. For example, charging an EV later or creating heat ahead of time to take advantage of lower prices, lower CO2 emissions, or peak demand avoidance. These goals are valuable to asset owners and utilities. The behind-the-meter segment is growing rapidly, and grid congestion and market price volatility are also increasing.</p>\n<p>FlexMeasures can help orchestrate a wide range of use cases, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Domestic buildings with heat pumps and EVs, optimized to lower energy costs under a dynamic tariff</li>\n<li>Neighborhoods with shared facilities and grid capacity constraints</li>\n<li>Office buildings with multiple EVs</li>\n<li>SME buildings with light industrial processes and solar roofs</li>\n<li>Large industrial plants with heat buffering systems</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"wp-image-10812 size-full aligncenter\"><i><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-1.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px\" srcset=\"https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-1.png 642w, https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-1-300x169.png 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"642\" height=\"362\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></i></p>\n<p><i>Figure 1: Behind-the-meter orchestration, as imagined by AI</i></p>\n<p>Now there are startups in smart charging and smart heating popping up, all of them re-inventing the smart orchestrating part, which essentially boils down to that energy flexibility problem: When should which device do what it needs to do?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>¬† ¬† ¬† Why not re-use a common and open technology for this smart scheduling, even share in developing it, making room for these startups to focus on their customer-facing value-add? Startups and ESCOs could save drastically on theirR&amp;D and engineering costs, as a complex aspect is now easier. It‚Äôs important to note that the orchestration challenge behind the meter structurally does not differ very much across the world. Electrification of transport (e-SUVs or e-scooters) and temperature regulation (heating or cooling) happens everywhere, and so does the stress this causes on electricity grids.</li>\n<li>¬† ¬† ¬† Talking about complexity, if you recall the use cases above, it is obvious that owners aim to optimize all devices together, orchestrating them as one. They only have one energy contract, after all. Smart charging and smart heating/cooling combined (also called ‚Äúsector coupling‚Äù), adding a battery to the mix, adding dynamic tariffs and congestion limits. This orchestration problem is more complex than many startups realize at first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, the customer is different per startup or ESCO, and per region. They should concentrate on designing this ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù towards local culture, customer expectations and conditions of hardware and markets. This leads to a unique UX, custom device integrations and so on. In principle, the logic of orchestrating devices can be served by the same smart back-end. Why not use an open source one?</p>\n<figure class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10811 size-full\"><i><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px\" srcset=\"https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-2.png 642w, https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-2-300x81.png 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"642\" height=\"173\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></i></p>\n<p><i>Figure 2: Some screenshots of the FlexMeasures UI</i></p>\n<p><strong>FlexMeasures in Action</strong></p>\n<p>Here are two testimonials of startups that have implemented FlexMeasures to use smart orchestration in their own innovative energy services:</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Thiink Inc (U.S.)</span><br>‚ÄúFlexMeasures is a great way to start creating an energy management system solution.

The cars operate in a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) mode, so apart from smart charging (taking advantage of longer parking times and local PV), the orchestration can also plan discharging back to the grid using dynamic energy tariffs. The local control (on-site EMS) has also been co-developed by Seita for this specific service. The cars charge and discharge schedules take into account user-defined set points (e.g. for longer rides) and keep the battery within user-defined limits (e.g. 20%-80% state of charge) and otherwise optimize economic results from the dynamic tariff (spot market prices).</p>\n<figure class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10809 size-full\"><i><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-4.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px\" srcset=\"https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-4.png 642w, https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-4-300x161.png 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"642\" height=\"344\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></i></p>\n<p><i>Figure 4: The V2GLiberty dashboard, with smart charging schedules powered by FlexMeasures</i></p>\n<p>As of Q1 2025, we have collected around three years of operational data (Q4 2022) and we see that less than 0.01‚Ç¨ has been paid for each driven kilometer.

So far, FlexMeasures could model hard constraints (e.g. consumption limit) and an optimization signal, usually a price per kWh. Both of these examples are penalties or rewards for energy commitments, that influence in distinct ways how the FlexMeasures scheduler will optimize the aggregated energy profile of the site.</p>\n<p>But behind the meter, there are more intricate constraints, penalties and rewards, as different parties (e.g. the DSO, the day ahead market operator and the local business) have different ideas about how energy should be used. Especially the modeling of the congestion problem inspired us to extend how FlexMeasures can model the different needs.</p>\n<p>With 0.24, any number of commitments which have their own reward or penalties can be modeled in the same optimization, and the scheduler will try to get the best overall profile.</p>\n<p>This is a big step towards capturing more goals of behind-the-meter orchestration. It was not trivial to model this extension. From here on, FlexMeasures has much more expressive power!</p>\n<p>Here is an example, which is inspired from a situation with a highly congested grid (as we experience in The Netherlands). Note that in the main PR you find a test which models this example, as well). Suppose that within the same optimization of schedules, we want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use a day-ahead tariff for pricing our energy purchasing -&gt; buy low, sell high</li>\n<li>model the DSO costs, as well (the DSO's monthly invoice depends on the highest peak) -&gt; modulate how high peaks get within the contracted capacity</li>\n<li>allow breaching the contracted consumption capacity, but incentivize the scheduler (with a penalty) to attempt avoiding this as much as possible</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2.png\" alt=\"Illustration of possible options for the FlexMeasures scheduler after v0.24 (not exhaustive, e.g. set points are not shown)\" width=\"879\" height=\"546\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-2xl.png 1600w\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>That last point seems counter-intuitive (allow breaching contracted capacity, but penalize it), but during simulations with different battery sizes, we found it invaluable that the contractual limits are not hard constraints, so we still get the best schedules, even on days where the battery cannot on its own keep the consumption within limits. Note that the <em>physical limits</em> can also be added, and should be hard constraints.¬†</p>\n<p>The scheduler will take all these goals into consideration, using existing and new flex-context fields like <code class=\"notranslate\">site-peak-consumption-price</code>, <code class=\"notranslate\">site-peak-consumption-breach</code>and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">site-peak-consumption</span></code>¬†(check <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/scheduling.html#the-flex-context\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the documentation</a> for details).</p>\n<p>Note that after the fact, the actual reporting of costs can represent what will actually be invoiced, e.g. energy purchasing (dynamic tariff) and peak costs by the DSO, but not the penalty used to avoid peak breaches.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1144\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1144</a>¬†and <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1254\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1254</a>.</p>\n<h2>Editing your own graph dashboard in the UI</h2>\n<p>The asset page is where FlexMeasures shows you data (measurements, schedules, etc) in graphs.

E.g. a site constraint can be a static kW value, but also point to a sensor, where the different capacities per time of day are recorded.</p>\n<p>In v0.23, we made substantial progress on both goals.</p>\n<p>We merged existing approaches in a single schema, <code class=\"notranslate\">VariableQuantityField</code> (we also made sure we remain backwards-compatible for a while).</p>\n<p>Now, across all of flex-context and flex-model, there are different ways to tell FlexMeasures about the optimization problem:</p>\n<ul dir=\"auto\">\n<li>As a constant quantity, such as:\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\">\n<pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">\"10 kW\"\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"zeroclipboard-container position-absolute right-0 top-0\">Note that the unit is part of the message. This is the most direct &amp; easy way.<br><br></div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>As a time series, such as:\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\">\n<pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">[\n    {\n        \"value\": 51,\n        \"start\": \"2024-02-04T10:35:00+01:00\",\n        \"end\": \"2024-02-05T04:25:00+01:00\"\n    }\n]\n</code></pre>\n<div class=\"zeroclipboard-container position-absolute right-0 top-0\">This is making it easy to describe temporary blocks, e.g. a few hours where the state of charge should not go below a certain value.¬†<br>(NB this example assumes the unit is specified via a separate field).<br><br></div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>As a sensor, such as:\n<div class=\"snippet-clipboard-content notranslate position-relative overflow-auto\">\n<pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">{\n    \"sensor\": 101\n}</code><code class=\"notranslate\"></code></pre>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>In the last example, the data's meta information (such as units) is stored in the sensor objects, and the data is looked up via the sensor table. This is best for highly dynamic data, e.g. prices loaded by a third-party API.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1127\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1127</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1138</a>.</p>\n<p>One more thing in this domain: We can also now express prices as fixed quantities - they were always modelled as series before. Sometimes that is what is needed to test a control strategy. See Pull Request <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/1028\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1028</a>.</p>\n<h2>Faster asset &amp; account page</h2>\n<p>When a lot of accounts and assets are added, we noticed that FlexMeasures took too ling for admins to load the complete lists. We addressed some speed bumps and also added pagination in the asset API and UI, so that the user experience improves.</p>\n<p>See Pull Request <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/988\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">988</a>.</p>\n<h2>Adding titles to graphs</h2>\n<p>The graphs on the asset page are the go-to place for watching schedules next to the underlying data. Basically, there we find the data dashboard in FlexMeasures. <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/views/asset-data.html#the-asset-page-as-data-dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The sensor_to_show attribute</a> which directs the setup of this dashbaord became more powerful.¬†</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"540\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/43/responsive/Screenshot-from-2024-09-17-17-11-47-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>The image above now not only shows the plots (with one or two sensor each), but has titles for two plots, and this is the configuration for that:<br><br><code>\"sensors_to_show\":[</code><br><code>¬† ¬† {\"title\": \"Prices\", \"sensors\":[58, 70]},</code><br><code>¬† ¬† 16,</code><br><code>¬† ¬† {\"title\": \"Battery activity\", \"sensors\": [5, 4]},</code><br><code>¬† ¬† 15</code><br><code>]</code></p>\n<p>See Pull Request <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/issues/1125\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1125</a>.</p>",
