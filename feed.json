The flex-context has been configurable on the asset via a UI dialogue since version 0.25 (and not only via the API when scheduling).

Here, state of charge (SoC) settings matter a lot - it is a heat buffer. Charging Efficiency is 300% ― a COP of 3.<br><br>As with the flex-context, many settings can be dynamic. In essence, they can be sensors. For example, the SoC Min setting can be a sensor, so you can plan different flexibility headrooms for different days of the week (an office can be cold in the weekend, so the heat storage has more flex to \"play\" with in the scheduling). Often, forecasts are instrumental in such dynamic settings, and we will have a major update on those in v0.30!<br><br>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1429\">1429</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1565\">1565</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1713\">1713</a>. (the PR IDs tell you that we needed to work on this a long time, as it touches the core of scheduling, and we took care of migrating older attributes that were used for similar things beforehand, for backwards compatibility)</p>\n<h2>Open API / SwaggerUI</h2>\n<p>The FlexMeasures API is rather rich (and has grown!). It is crucial for integrating FlexMeasures into other systems, i.e. IoT gateways that send data and pull schedules, or custom UIs / dashboards. Or custom client scripts which setup new assets and sensors, for automating the addition and control of sites.<br><br>We document the API endpoints via Sphinx, but it would be much more developer-friendly to do that with the OpenAPI standard. In particular, developers want to browse available endpoints on a host, and even try them out live - this is possible with SwaggerUI, which was the originator for what is now OpenAPI, and still the most-used API UI.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper gallery-wrapper--wide\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/53/gallery/Screenshot-from-2025-10-10-11-23-51.png\" data-size=\"1444x751\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/53/gallery/Screenshot-from-2025-10-10-11-23-51-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"List of endpoints\" width=\"720\" height=\"374\"></a>\n<figcaption>List of endpoints</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/53/gallery/Screenshot-from-2025-10-13-14-43-23.png\" data-size=\"1297x920\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/53/gallery/Screenshot-from-2025-10-13-14-43-23-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"Trying out an endpoint from SwaggerUI\" width=\"720\" height=\"511\"></a>\n<figcaption>Trying out an endpoint from SwaggerUI</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests<a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1703\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1703</a>.</p>\n</div>",

We already have used FlexMeasures to schedule sites with more than one flexible device (e.g. also EVs), but with one caveat: we scheduled one flexible device after the other (sequentially - we'll add a short explanation below).</p>\n<p>Anyway, we were lacking an endpoint to run one simultaneuous optimization for a combined schedule, and after several preparation steps and testing in the last few months, we added <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/latest/api/v3_0.html#post--api-v3_0-assets-(id)-schedules-trigger\">this one</a>:</p>\n<p><code><span class=\"sig-name descname\"><span class=\"pre\">POST</span> </span><span class=\"sig-name descname\"><span class=\"pre\">/api/v3_0/assets/</span></span><span class=\"sig-paren\">(</span><em class=\"sig-param\"><span class=\"pre\">id</span></em><span class=\"sig-paren\">)</span><span class=\"sig-name descname\"><span class=\"pre\">/schedules/trigger</span></span></code></p>\n<p>\"Trigger FlexMeasures to create a schedule for a collection of flexible and inflexible devices.\"</p>\n<p>Of course, we stay true to the ambition that each device can be steered so that the schedule fits its unique constraints, and thus telling FlexMeasures about the flex-models can look like this:</p>\n<pre id=\"codecell6\"><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"start\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"2015-06-02T10:00:00+00:00\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"flex-model\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">931</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"soc-at-start\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mf\">12.1</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"soc-unit\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"kWh\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"power-capacity\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"25kW\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"consumption-capacity\"</span> <span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nt\">\"sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">42</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"production-capacity\"</span> <span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"30 kW\"</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">932</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"consumption-capacity\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"0 kW\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"nt\">\"production-capacity\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nt\">\"sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">760</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">],</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">\"flex-context\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"consumption-price-sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">9</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"production-price-sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"inflexible-device-sensors\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span><span class=\"mi\">13</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">14</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">15</span><span class=\"p\">],</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"site-power-capacity\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"100kW\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"site-production-capacity\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s2\">\"80kW\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"nt\">\"site-consumption-capacity\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"nt\">\"sensor\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">32</span><span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span></pre>\n<p>This is for two devices (see the endpoint docs for more explanation of this example). For more flexible devices, the body becomes longer.  Luckily, we are also working on letting you specify all flex-model fields on the asset data models (for flex-context, that already is the case). </p>\n<p>We are really happy that this finally is in place. This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1065\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1065</a> , but actually you'll find preparation steps going back more than 6 months. </p>\n<p>Now, how does \"sequential\" scheduling work? After each device we scheduled, we were adding the already scheduled ones to the list of inflexible devices, so the next schedule would take them into account. This approach might scale better with a large number of devices, but we found that the new simultaneous approach also works well with ~100 devices. However, it is still an interesting approach, so the new endpoint offers it, as well (just pass<code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">sequential=true</span></code>).</p>\n<h2>Two-factor authentication</h2>\n<p>Cyber-security is more and more crucial when running a serious service - and that is what we aim FlexMeasures to be.</p>\n<p>That means we had to increase the level of security. A lot of that happens in anybody's cloud environment, but FlexMeasures itself needs to also be hardened. </p>\n<p>So version 0.27 adds Two-factor Authentication, the mechanism where only one factor (your password) is not enough to log into the service. In this first implementation, users need a separate token, as well, which is sent to their email address.

This is an important step in scheduling that behaves according to the priorities of each site.</p>\n<p>Also, the UI for showing assets got an important update - we split the overloaded asset page into several pages. This improves browsing and loading times.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/latest/changelog.html#v0-26-0-june-03-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See the changelog</a> for a complete list of improvements (49 PRs!).</p>\n<p>Let's dive int the two main features!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">\n<h2>Relaxed scheduling</h2>\n<p>You can tell FlexMeasures to find an optimal schedule within a list of constraints (e.g. grid constraints, minimum fill level of EV batteries etc.). Sometimes the perfect solution does not exist. FlexMeasures should still present a schedule that is the best it can do. But which goal/constraint is most important? We are working on letting the user decide.</p>\n<p>Let us consider a simple example: In the V2G Liberty project (which uses FlexMeasures as a scheduling backend), the user can give a minimal charge level, for when they plan longer trips. FlexMeasure should attempt to reach this target, but sometimes the user might have given FlexMeasures too little time to accomplish that.</p>\n<p>Here is a visualization:</p>\n<figure ><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/V2GLiberty-Screenshot.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"549\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/49/responsive/V2GLiberty-Screenshot-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption >The V2GLiberty app, showing FlexMeasures' schedule (orange) and the minimal-charge window (blue)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Here, the minimal charge window cannot be reached, but FlexMeasures will reach the minimal level as early as possible. In earlier version of the FlexMeasures scheduler, it might have told you that no valid solution exists. But of course, here the user wants it to try.</p>\n<p>If there are multiple competing goals/constraints, it becomes a matter of priority. In FlexMeasures, penalties can now be set for any breaches of these goals/constrains, which is a way for the system operator to determine which of them matters more than others.</p>\n<div class=\"message-body normal-message-body\" data-v-62a2ac48=\"\">\n<div class=\"message-main\" data-v-f2ec36a0=\"\" data-v-62a2ac48=\"\">\n<div class=\"message-main__text markdown-message\" data-v-f2ec36a0=\"\">\n<div class=\"rich-text--wrapper rich-text--wrapper-markdown\" dir=\"auto\" data-v-1de82f09=\"\" data-v-f2ec36a0=\"\">\n<div data-v-1de82f09=\"\">\n<div data-v-1de82f09=\"\">\n<p data-v-1de82f09=\"\">We have 3 types of relaxations (each in two directions) whose prices can all be set in the flex-context and flex-model:</p>\n<ul data-v-1de82f09=\"\">\n<li data-v-1de82f09=\"\">site-consumption-capacity / site-production-capacity</li>\n<li data-v-1de82f09=\"\">soc-minima / soc-maxima (for each device)</li>\n<li data-v-1de82f09=\"\">consumption-capacity / production-capacity (for each device)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For instance, there is a <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">site-consumption-breach-price</span></code> attribute in the flex-context, where you could tell FlexMeasures that <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">site-consumption-capacity</span></code> is a soft constraint, but how important it is to you. You could set it to 1000 EUR/MW (if your optimization problem uses EUR as target). You could think of the setting as a (contractual) penalty.

One of the most pressing challenges is managing the increasing demand for electricity while ensuring grid stability and minimizing costs. Additionally, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power makes it difficult to match supply with demand, leading to potential grid imbalances.</p>\n<p>Energy flexibility is a solution to these challenges. It refers to the ability to adjust energy consumption and production in response to changes in supply, demand, or prices. This can be achieved through a variety of technologies and strategies, such as smart appliances, energy storage systems, and demand response programs.</p>\n<p>FlexMeasures is an open source EMS platform for optimizing energy flexibility, built for innovative startups and digitally-enabled energy service companies (ESCOs).</p>\n<p>Think of it as the “Lego Mindstorms” of smart energy planning – combining out-of-the-box functionality (like the algorithms but also UIs and APIs) with modularity, so your digital energy service has the ability for smart orchestration of behind-the-meter assets.</p>\n<p>Developed by<a href=\"https://seita.nl/\"> Seita Energy Flexibility</a>, a Dutch-German startup and contributed to <a href=\"https://lfenergy.org/\">LF Energy</a>, FlexMeasures is already being adopted by smart energy startups worldwide. These startups are leveraging its versatile, developer-friendly tools to build impactful solutions for energy planning and optimization, often using FlexMeasures as the basis for their EMS design.</p>\n<p><strong>The Opportunity of Energy Flexibility</strong></p>\n<p>A device is energy-flexible when its consumption can be shifted in time. For example, charging an EV later or creating heat ahead of time to take advantage of lower prices, lower CO2 emissions, or peak demand avoidance. These goals are valuable to asset owners and utilities.

Startups and ESCOs could save drastically on theirR&amp;D and engineering costs, as a complex aspect is now easier. It’s important to note that the orchestration challenge behind the meter structurally does not differ very much across the world. Electrification of transport (e-SUVs or e-scooters) and temperature regulation (heating or cooling) happens everywhere, and so does the stress this causes on electricity grids.</li>\n<li>      Talking about complexity, if you recall the use cases above, it is obvious that owners aim to optimize all devices together, orchestrating them as one. They only have one energy contract, after all. Smart charging and smart heating/cooling combined (also called “sector coupling”), adding a battery to the mix, adding dynamic tariffs and congestion limits. This orchestration problem is more complex than many startups realize at first.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, the customer is different per startup or ESCO, and per region. They should concentrate on designing this “last mile” towards local culture, customer expectations and conditions of hardware and markets. This leads to a unique UX, custom device integrations and so on. In principle, the logic of orchestrating devices can be served by the same smart back-end.

You can easily simulate and test without having all the energy hardware. The built-in UI makes it easy to visualize what is going on. Using the terminology of the USEF framework is also good and helps people acquire a terminology that helps with understanding of the European energy markets.”<br>— Ragnar Edholm (Senior Vice President of Engineering), <a href=\"https://thiink.com/\">Thiink Inc</a></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">iRasus Technologies (India)</span><br>“In India, we currently see three use cases for battery energy storage systems (BESS): round-the-clock solar power, islanding and frequency regulation in a grid, and diesel generator replacement. We aim to use FlexMeasures for the steering logic that will connect the monitoring and the control. For this logic, price-based scheduling and forecasting as an ancillary feature are important to us. In India, any optimisation tool needs to be better than a guy with a full-time job trying to do the same using Excel, because India has loads of such people at affordable salaries for employers. What’s exciting here is the option to have interoperability and customisation.

It starts as a basis for building your smart energy services, then helps you extend with custom features and finally supports scaling up. Here is a high-level list of features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>    Cloud Energy Management System (API-first)</li>\n<li>    Built-in algorithms (e.g., vehicle-to-grid, batteries, processes)</li>\n<li>    Use cases for heating, cooling, charging and beyond</li>\n<li>    Plugin/extensibility options (open source examples: OpenWeatherMap, ENTSO-E data platform)</li>\n<li>    White-label solutions for branding the in-built UI</li>\n<li>    Support for servicing customers: connectivity status pages, audit logs, monitoring</li>\n<li>    Scalability: task queuing for distribution across CPUs</li>\n<li>    Self-service: customers/partners can adapt device settings and graphs in the UI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>FlexMeasures fits into the modern energy stack as a “cloud EMS”. As devices become digitized and connectable, sites require some “<a href=\"https://withthegrid.com/what-is-an-on-site-ems-energy-management-system/\">on-site EMS</a>” to control local flows – usually hardware with device integrations and business rules. FlexMeasures serves as a planning system which combines more information than is available locally, and plans the optimal schedules for the site.</p>\n<figure class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10810 size-full\"><i><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-3.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px\" srcset=\"https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-3.png 642w, https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-3-300x82.png 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"642\" height=\"176\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></i></p>\n<p><i>Figure 3: Layers of a modern energy site</i></p>\n<p>FlexMeasures features are constantly improved, but the two biggest additions on the roadmap are an algorithm dedicated to Virtual Power Plant settings (VPP) and adding support for open energy flexibility standards, like<a href=\"https://s2standard.org/\"> S2</a> and<a href=\"https://www.openadr.org/\"> OpenADR</a>, so FlexMeasures can become a tool within an open technology eco-system.</p>\n<p><strong>Real World Domestic Energy Management Example: V2G App in The Netherlands</strong></p>\n<p>Seita has used FlexMeasures to orchestrate the batteries of more than ten Nissan Leafs, each in their own building.

The local control (on-site EMS) has also been co-developed by Seita for this specific service. The cars charge and discharge schedules take into account user-defined set points (e.g. for longer rides) and keep the battery within user-defined limits (e.g. 20%-80% state of charge) and otherwise optimize economic results from the dynamic tariff (spot market prices).</p>\n<figure class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10809 size-full\"><i><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-4.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px\" srcset=\"https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-4.png 642w, https://lfenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/02/Flexmeasures-Fig-4-300x161.png 300w\" alt=\"\" width=\"642\" height=\"344\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure></i></p>\n<p><i>Figure 4: The V2GLiberty dashboard, with smart charging schedules powered by FlexMeasures</i></p>\n<p>As of Q1 2025, we have collected around three years of operational data (Q4 2022) and we see that less than 0.01€ has been paid for each driven kilometer.

So far, FlexMeasures could model hard constraints (e.g. consumption limit) and an optimization signal, usually a price per kWh. Both of these examples are penalties or rewards for energy commitments, that influence in distinct ways how the FlexMeasures scheduler will optimize the aggregated energy profile of the site.</p>\n<p>But behind the meter, there are more intricate constraints, penalties and rewards, as different parties (e.g. the DSO, the day ahead market operator and the local business) have different ideas about how energy should be used. Especially the modeling of the congestion problem inspired us to extend how FlexMeasures can model the different needs.</p>\n<p>With 0.24, any number of commitments which have their own reward or penalties can be modeled in the same optimization, and the scheduler will try to get the best overall profile.</p>\n<p>This is a big step towards capturing more goals of behind-the-meter orchestration. It was not trivial to model this extension. From here on, FlexMeasures has much more expressive power!</p>\n<p>Here is an example, which is inspired from a situation with a highly congested grid (as we experience in The Netherlands). Note that in the main PR you find a test which models this example, as well). Suppose that within the same optimization of schedules, we want to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>use a day-ahead tariff for pricing our energy purchasing -&gt; buy low, sell high</li>\n<li>model the DSO costs, as well (the DSO's monthly invoice depends on the highest peak) -&gt; modulate how high peaks get within the contracted capacity</li>\n<li>allow breaching the contracted consumption capacity, but incentivize the scheduler (with a penalty) to attempt avoiding this as much as possible</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2.png\" alt=\"Illustration of possible options for the FlexMeasures scheduler after v0.24 (not exhaustive, e.g. set points are not shown)\" width=\"879\" height=\"546\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/45/responsive/v0.24-commitments.drawio-2-2xl.png 1600w\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>That last point seems counter-intuitive (allow breaching contracted capacity, but penalize it), but during simulations with different battery sizes, we found it invaluable that the contractual limits are not hard constraints, so we still get the best schedules, even on days where the battery cannot on its own keep the consumption within limits. Note that the <em>physical limits</em> can also be added, and should be hard constraints. </p>\n<p>The scheduler will take all these goals into consideration, using existing and new flex-context fields like <code class=\"notranslate\">site-peak-consumption-price</code>, <code class=\"notranslate\">site-peak-consumption-breach</code>and <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">site-peak-consumption</span></code> (check <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/scheduling.html#the-flex-context\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the documentation</a> for details).</p>\n<p>Note that after the fact, the actual reporting of costs can represent what will actually be invoiced, e.g. energy purchasing (dynamic tariff) and peak costs by the DSO, but not the penalty used to avoid peak breaches.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1144\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1144</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/pull/1254\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1254</a>.</p>\n<h2>Editing your own graph dashboard in the UI</h2>\n<p>The asset page is where FlexMeasures shows you data (measurements, schedules, etc) in graphs.
