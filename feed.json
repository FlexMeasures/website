            "content_html": "<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">\n<p>Version v0.18 of FlexMeasures advances the modeling of the flex optimization problem, adding more detail. If we have knowledge about future conditions and underlying physics, our optimization gets better when we put that to use!</p>\n<p>We also improved navigation in the UI, which is really handy for more complex asset structures.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#v0-18-0-december-21-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See the changelog</a> for a complete list. Read on below about the larger new features we added.</p>\n<h2>Future knowledge in scheduling</h2>\n<p>FlexMeasures lets you describe the underlying flexibility problem, so that the internal scheduler knows within what limits to work to find the best solution for the upcoming hours. Earlier, we introduced two data specifications for this, the <code>flex-model</code> (what are the limits and goal around this asset, e.g. maximal state of charge?) and the <code>flex-context</code> (what is also relevant, e.g. prices?). We wrote <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/v2g.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a tutorial with nice examples</a> around the V2G use case.</p>\n<p>Now, we have enhanced the flex-model with three new (or more nuanced) types of information, which lets FlexMeasures handle a wider range of modern energy flexibility problems. We also let them be sensors, instead of just one constant value. But more about that later, first let me introduce the new kinds of flex-model information:</p>\n<h3>External in- and output for storage</h3>\n<p>We can model storage assets which only serve the flexibility of the main system, e.g. a battery which only exists to simply buffer solar energy for self-consumption at some later time. The battery has no strict dependencies outside of our energy flexibility asset model.</p>\n<p>But often, storage (also) serves an external and crucial purpose. A good example is a hot water tank. Comfort of the home occupants is the main goal ― consuming energy to create heat at the best time is also important, but secondary.</p>\n<p>Thus, the expected extraction of energy (as heat) from the storage is an important input to the modeling problem ― it will form a constraint. In this example, the input of energy (as electricity) is dynamic, and can be timed optimally to lower the energy costs and/pr CO2.</p>\n<p>To handle these situations optimally, we introduced fields in the flex model to represent an expected extraction of stored energy (e.g. when we know the occupants are at home), or even addition (e.g. when an industrial process will add heat) ― we called them <span class=\"blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass \" data-code-marker=\"+\"><code><span class=\"pl-c1\">soc-usage</span></code> and <span class=\"pl-c1\"><code><span class=\"pl-token\">soc</span>-gain</code><span class=\"pl-token\">. This makes the flex model much more expressive. Obviously, these fields only work with the <code>StorageScheduler</code>.</span></span></span></p>\n<h3>Energy conversion efficiency</h3>\n<div>We noticed that the efficiency of turning electricity into usable energy is a crucial modelling factor, especially when modeling smart heating problems. <br>in earlier version, we supported conversion losses with a constant <span class=\"blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass \" data-code-marker=\"+\"><span class=\"pl-en\"><span class=\"pl-s\"><code>roundtrip-efficiency</code></span></span></span> value. Used as a percentage, this works well enough for batteries or even for heat losses that happen in an inverter.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>As an example where that breaks down, consider that the COP of Heat Pumps typically depends strongly on the outside temperature. To be able to model this more precisely within the optimization problem (losses are a crucial detail here), you can now use <span class=\"blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass \" data-code-marker=\"+\"><span class=\"pl-en\"><span class=\"pl-s\"><code>charging-efficiency</code> and <code>discharging-efficiency</code> separately, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">and</span> they can be time series (more about that below). The latter feature is what you need if the conditions for energy conversion efficiency are not constant, like outside temperature.</span></span></span></div>\n<h3>Consumption and production capacities</h3>\n<p>Until now, only one kind of maximal capacity was possible (for example, to describe a limit to the grid connection). We used the field <code>power-capacity</code>, and it had to have <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">one</span> constant value, e.g. 25 kW.</p>\n</div>\n<div><br>We made this more expressive. Look at the example below. </div>\n<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">\n<pre class=\"notranslate\"><code class=\"notranslate\">{\n    \"flex-model\": {\n        \"consumption-capacity\": \"25 kW\",\n        \"production-capacity\": {\"sensor\": 51}\n    }\n}</code></pre>\nWe can now differentiate between limits on production and consumption. <code>power-capacity</code>still works ― if it is given, it would serve as a limit on the other two.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<h3>Varying values over time!</h3>\n<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">Look at the above example for <code>production-capacity</code> again. This is not a constant value, but references a sensor. The added value here is that the allowed production capacity can vary over time.</div>\n<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">This might soon be relevant in practice, as DSOs offer network contracts in which businesses have a varying grid connection capacity! (next to offering, they might even force businesses to use them, if grid congestion is high).</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">But also for the two other examples we discussed above (where values can also be a constant number or a sensor from now on), a varying series of values might help you model reality more closely.</div>\n<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">906,</a> <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/933\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">933</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/897\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">897</a>. </p>\n<h2>UI navigation of complex sites</h2>\n<p>Behind the scenes, we work with more complex asset structures. We have introduced the capability of assets being the child of another asset. Now, tree-like structures can be built (where sensors are the leaves, usually) in order to model whole sites or different scenarios for simulation projects.</p>\n<p>This also calls for efforts to navigate this structures. We are looking to develop a visual representation of this tree-structure. But until we get there, we made it easier to navigate the structure.</p>\n<p>First, we introduced a breadcrump-bar above the asset and sensor pages. This example has the account, the asset and the currently shown sensor:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/breadcrump-example.png\" alt=\"Breadcrumps bar in FlexMeasures\" width=\"500\" height=\"172\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/36/responsive/breadcrump-example-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<p>Second, we made lists of assets and sensors easy to click. The whole row will now react to one simple click and take you where you want to go!</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/930\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">930</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/923\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">923</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n</div>",

And the ESCo should be able to consult their clients, for instance for servicing questions and problems. And this means to see their data.</p>\n<p>We now enabled that. This unlocks using FlexMeasures in more powerful hosting scenarios.</p>\n<p>Each account can now have a consultant account linked. Users in that account who have the role <code>consultant</code> will now be able to see the client's asset and data. In the UI, each client's account page shows who their consultant is, and consultants will see who their client accounts are and can access them from there. The API also allows read access for consultants.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/877\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">877</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/892\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">892</a>. </p>\n<p>Future work might add the ability to also add or edit assets and sensors.</p>\n<h2>Fallback schedulers<code></code></h2>\n<p>Sometimes a schedule might not be feasible. This happens for example when a strict state-of-charge target for a storage was set, but can't be reached in time. In FlexMeasures, a fallback scheduler can then try to reach as close to that target as possible. But it's crucial to deal with this situation and visualize it.</p>\n<p>We enabled for FlexMasures hosts that they separate background jobs in this case (e.g. one run by <code>StorageScheduler</code> and one run by <code>FallbackStorageScheduler</code>). By giving them distinct data sources, it can also be visualized better in the UI that the schedules are somewhat different (a \"perfect\" one and a \"good enough\" one).</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/846\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">846</a>,  <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/841\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">841</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/888\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">888</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/891\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">891</a>.</p>\n<h2>New favicon: <figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/35/favicon.ico\" alt=\"\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\"></figure></h2>\n<p>We noticed that the FlexMeasures UI was not using a favicon which represents its logo (within LF Energy).

We are continuing to make it more useful. We already made it possible to have a reporter aggregate sensors (<code><cite>AggregatorReporter</cite></code>) or use Pandas methods on sensor data (<code><cite>PandasReporter</cite></code>) ― this had a lot of power so KPIs could be made.</p>\n<p>In this version, we added an implementation that should cover a use case right off the shelf for almost everyone using FlexMeasures: a reporter to compute how profitable your operation has been (<em><code>ProfitLossReporter</code></em>). Showing the results of optimization is a crucial feature, and now easier than ever.</p>\n<p>We also wrote <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tut/toy-example-reporter.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a tutorial</a> for using it in your installation. Here are some excerpts (note that that tutorial also shows other reporting types).</p>\n<p>First, reporters can now be stored as data sources, so they are easy to be used repeatedly and the data they generate can reference them.

The way this could be encoded before was not very user-friendly (as asset or sensor attribute). We have now added the fields <code class=\"notranslate\">storage_power_capacity_in_mw</code> and <code class=\"notranslate\">ems_power_capacity_in_mw</code>, respectively, so that the flex model can encode this explicitly (the flex model can be sent to the API when triggering schedules and soon be stored on the asset itself).</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/850\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">850</a>.</p>\n</div>",

From our experience, this is where you see the most interesting activity hotspots at a glance. For instance, that mornings often experience peaks. Or that Tuesday afternoons have low energy use, for some reason.</p>\n<p>Here is how it looks like for one week of temperature data:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18.png\" alt=\"Temperature data in new heatmap\" width=\"800\" height=\"239\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/Screenshot-from-2023-07-29-17-09-18-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption>It's easy to see which days had milder temperatures.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>And here are 4 days of (dis)-charging patterns in Seita's <a href=\"https://v2g-liberty.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">V2GLiberty</a> project:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"249\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/33/responsive/DailyMatrix-NissanLeaf-2xl.png 1600w\"></figure>\n<figcaption>Charging (blue) mostly happens in sunshine hours, discharging during high-price hours (morning &amp; evening)</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>So on a technical level, the daily heatmap is essentially a heatmap of the sensor's values, with dates on the y-axis and time of day on the x-axis.

            "content_html": "<div class=\"post__inner post__entry\">\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">We've taken a crucial step in making FlexMeasures even more developer-friendly! Last week, we released version 0.1 of the new <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/flexmeasures-client\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FlexMeasures client</a>.</p>\n<p>What is the use of a client library for the FlexMeasures platform? Well, FlexMeasures is foremost a web server ― it calculates optimal schedules for flexible energy assets in the cloud, according to price, CO2 output or other constraints. Its API is <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">well-documented</a>. Even though APIs are one of the web architecture's shining beacons, it's not really convenient for developers to use them directly. That's where developer-friendly tooling, like client libraries, come in!</p>\n<p>The FlexMeasures client wraps the most important interactions you need to add if you interact with FlexMeasures. For example, if you are connecting a local energy management system (EMS) to be optimized via FlexMeasures, you would need authentication, data I/O and the triggering of new computations. With the client, these functionalities are now as easy to use as calling a function. For instance, here we authorize to a FlexMeasures server, request a schedule for a battery charging sensor and retrieve it (once it's computed):</p>\n<pre><code>import asyncio\n\nfrom flexmeasures_client.client import FlexMeasuresClient\n\nEMAIL = \"admin@admin.nl\"\nPASSWORD = \"admin\"\n\nasync def my_script():\n    schedule = await flexmeasures_client.trigger_and_get_schedule(\n        sensor_id=1,\n        start=\"2023-06-18T10:00:00+00:00\",\n        duration=\"PT45M\",\n        soc_unit=\"MWh\",\n        soc_at_start=50,\n        soc_targets=[\n            {\n                \"value\": 100,\n                \"datetime\": \"2023-06-20T11:00+02:00\",\n            }\n        ],\n        consumption_price_sensor=3,\n    )<br>    print(schedule)\n\nclient = FlexMeasuresClient(\n    email=EMAIL,\n    password=PASSWORD,\n    host=\"localhost:5000\",\n)\n\nasyncio.run(my_script())</code></pre>\n<p>The FlexMeasures Client is written in Python, so it's most useful for Python developers. In principle, other languages could follow.</p>\n<p>At Seita, we first started using the client in a new service with <a href=\"https://projecten.topsectorenergie.nl/projecten/turbineketel-nestore-en-seita-ems-voor-het-aardgasvrij-maken-van-wijken-tunes-37596\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">smart heat storage control</a> and in <a href=\"https://v2g-liberty.eu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our V2G project</a>. The FlexMeasures client will evolve together with the FlexMeasures API. For instance, adding sensors is <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/projects/18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a feature you can expect soon</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition, to the most important interactions, we're also adding an S2 layer (<a href=\"https://flexible-energy.eu/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Energy-Management-Opportunities-for-The-Home.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S2</a> is a new flexible asset protocol, with explicit flexibility expression ability). We'll talk more about S2 in another blog post.</p>\n<p>If you're trying out the FlexMeasures Client, we'd love to hear from you. Is it useful? What can be improved? You can add issues on <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures-client\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the Github project page</a>. And of course, stars as well as pull requests are welcome :)</p>\n</div>",

They come together in the FlexMeasures scheduling algorithms.</p>\n<p>However, there are more use cases for enriching these data by combining them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Pre-calculations: E.g. from a tariff and some tax rules we compute the real financial impact of price data.</li>\n<li>Post-calculations: To be able to show the customer value, we regularly want to compute things like money or CO2 saved.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These calculations can be done with code, but there'll be many repetitions. </p>\n<p>We now added an infrastructure that allows us to define computation pipelines (see an example below) and CLI commands for developers to list available reporters and trigger their computations regularly:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code><span class=\"blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass\" data-code-marker=\"+\"><span class=\"pl-c1\">flexmeasures show reporters</span></span></code></li>\n<li><code><span class=\"blob-code-inner blob-code-marker js-code-nav-pass\" data-code-marker=\"+\"><span class=\"pl-c1\">flexmeasures add report</span></span></code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reporter classes we are designing are using pandas under the hood and can be sub-classed, allowing us to build new reporters from stable simpler ones, and even pipelines. Remember: <em>re-use is developer power</em>!</p>\n<p>We believe this infrastructure will become very powerful and enable FlexMeasures hosters and plugin developers to implement exciting new features.</p>\n<p>So here is a glimpse into a reporter we made - it is based on the <code>AggregatorReporter</code> (which is for the combination of any two sensors). This simplified example reporter calculates how much of your local PV power has not been covered by your own consumption:</p>\n<pre class=\"notranslate\">{\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"beliefs_search_configs\"</span>: [\n        {\n            <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"sensor\"</span>: <span class=\"pl-c1\">1</span>,\n            <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"source\"</span> : <span class=\"pl-c1\">1</span>,\n            <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"alias\"</span> : <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>pv<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\n        },\n        {\n            <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"sensor\"</span>: 2,\n            <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"source\"</span> : <span class=\"pl-c1\">2</span>,\n            <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"alias\"</span> : <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"<span class=\"pl-ent\">consumption</span></span><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>\n        }\n    ],\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"method\"</span> : <span class=\"pl-s\"><span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span>sum<span class=\"pl-pds\">\"</span></span>,\n    <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"weights\"</span> : {\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"pv\"</span> : <span class=\"pl-c1\">1.0</span>,\n        <span class=\"pl-ent\">\"consumption\"</span> : <span class=\"pl-c1\">-1.0</span>\n    }\n}</pre>\n<p>Much more elaborate reporters are possible to be done this way, and we will showcase more later. </p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/641\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">641</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/659\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">659</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/712\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">712</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/686\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">686</a>. </p>\n<p>P.S. We are not done. You are invited to follow along in <a href=\"https://github.com/FlexMeasures/flexmeasures/discussions/662\">the current discussion</a>, where you'll find new ideas like the <code class=\"notranslate\">EnergyBillReporter</code>or the <code>CO2Reporter</code>. We might even support YAML for even higher readability!</p>\n<h2>Working on heat scheduling: storage efficiency</h2>\n<p>Optimizing heat storage is our next big goal, after our work towards batteries. </p>\n<p>We have decided to extend the in-built storage scheduling algorithm towards this goal. There might be other approaches for solving some complex heat storage configurations with custom advanced algorithms, but we believe that a majority of cases can be solved in-built.</p>\n<p>The first action was to support the buffer-like behavior of heat storage, namely that energy (heat) is being lost over time. This lead to the new parameter <code>storage-efficiency</code>, which is now part of the <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/notation.html#flex-model\">flex model</a>. So now we can express that a hot water storage tank will lose around 1% of the stored heat per day. This will be reflected in what the scheduler finds to be optimal.</p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/679\">679</a>.</p>\n<h2>Developer support: docs, packaging</h2>\n<p>We extended the core team that works on FlexMeasures, and that is always an opportunity to spot problems in the support for developers. We added two main improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better developer docs, making it easier to install FlexMeasures and understand what it's doing (Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/664\">664</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/665\">665</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/676\">676</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/687\">687</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/698\">698</a>)</li>\n<li>Packaging improvements, making it easier to use FlexMeasures in deployments (Pull Requests: <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/670\">670</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/671\">671</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>API sunsetting</h2>\n<p>Finally, as <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/note-on-datamodel-transition.html#note-on-datamodel-transition\">our long journey to a more flexible datamodel</a> is coming close to completion, we are sunsetting (as we pre-announced in version 0.12) API versions below 3. Please help your users upgrade to API version 3 before you use FlexMeasures v0.14!</p>\n<p>While version 0.13 still allowed hosts to get the sunset endpoints back if needed, we now have sunsetted them and they return HTTP status code 410 by default.</p>\n<p>We compiled <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/introduction.html#deprecation-and-sunset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">some helpful information for FlexMeasures hosts </a>to manage this transition well.  </p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/667\">667</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>",

Both also give the using systems automated signals: HTTP headers label the stage implicitly (deprecation or sunset), and HTTP status codes do that explicitly (e.g. moving from 200 OK to 410 Gone and finally 404 NotFound).<br><br>In short, a blackout test would temporarily simulate the removal (return 410 instead of 200) for a pre-announced short while, maybe an hour. <br><br>That should really get everyone's attention :)<br><br>If you are hosting FlexMeasures, then from version 0.14 on, a blackout test can be activated by changing a simple setting (<a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#flexmeasures-api-sunset-active\">FLEXMEASURES_API_SUNSET_ACTIVE</a>).<br><br>If you are a user connected to a FlexMeasures server, this simply means you will be served better. Fewer surprises, still innovation!</span></span></p>",

By default, you see a plot per sensor. With the <code>sensors_to_show</code> attribute, it was already possible to remove and even add plots (e.g. public price data), to create the dashboard with maximum information value.</p>\n<p>We wanted to make the dashboards more informative, as often users want to study effects of one sensor's data on others.</p>\n<p>Now, sensor numbers in <code>sensors_to_show</code> can be layered, e.g. <code>[1, [3,6]]</code> will lead to two plots, where the second shows two sensors together.</p>\n<p>As a bonus, plots are distinguished by source (different trace), sensor (different color) and source type (different stroke dash).</p>\n<p>Here is an example (see the overlay of EV charging and PV supply in the lower graph):</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/29/layered-chart.png\" alt=\"A layered chart from Seita's V2G living lab\" width=\"800\" height=\"375\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/29/responsive/layered-chart-xs.png 300w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/29/responsive/layered-chart-sm.png 480w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/29/responsive/layered-chart-md.png 768w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/29/responsive/layered-chart-lg.png 1024w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/29/responsive/layered-chart-xl.png 1360w ,https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/29/responsive/layered-chart-2xl.png 1600w\"><figcaption>A layered chart from Seita's V2G living lab</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">This work was done in Pull Request </span><a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/534\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">534</a><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">.</span></p>\n<h2>Account page</h2>\n<p>FlexMeasures is not just a single-purpose program ― it's a platform which can sit in the cloud and serve multiple sites. To manage these sites when they have different asset owners, the concept of accounts matters a lot. An account might for instance be a SME, with several local energy assets and also several employees (who might or might not have a FlexMeasures user account)</p>\n<p>That's why we worked on showing accounts better in the UI and API (in the CLI they are already represented well). The endpoints <code><cite>/accounts</cite></code> (to list accounts) and <code><cite>/accounts/&lt;id&gt;</cite></code> (to show one account) both work in the UI and (via <code>/api/v3_0/</code>) in the API.</p>\n<p>We tried to make this useful both for users (looking at their own account) and admins (looking at all accounts). In the future, we hope to work on \"consulting accounts\", who have the right to administer several other accounts (their clients), making FlexMeasures a potential B2B2B platform! </p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Request <a href=\"http://www.github.com/flexmeasures/flexmeasures/pull/605\">605</a>.</p>\n<h2>Avoid re-computing the same schedule</h2>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Computing schedules is where FlexMeasures creates its value, and also where it does the heavier CPU work. The more different sites we serve, the more we learn that it's crucial to protect this CPU work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Triggering schedules is easy, computing them is hard.<br>Here is an example scenario: A rogue client might trigger the same schedule multiple times ― a simple error, but overloading our server with work. In this feature, we enable FlexMeasures to notice that the same computation is already done or currently ongoing. This means not starting the computation again, and also informing the caller with the right status.</span></p>\n<p>Technically, we now cache the job, so that before FlexMeasures creates a new one, it can look up if the equivalent already exists somewhere in the queue.

In both simulations and real time operation, we found that our partners want to see how the data situation progressed over time.</p>\n<p>That's why we decided to add a replay-button to asset dashboards. It travels through time for you: </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://flexmeasures.io/media/posts/27/ReplayWithRuler.gif\" alt=\"Visualization of FlexMeasures data\" width=\"1257\" height=\"868\"><figcaption>Data from Seita's V2G living lab, played back in FlexMeasures</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">Where is this useful? We've seen this work very well in demos, and to explain why certain schedules were executed half-way, but then the rest got re-written. This happens because when new data arrives (e.g. prices change, an EV re-connects to the charger, etc.), FlexMeasures needs to re-compute the schedule. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">This <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flexmeasures/status/1551841500815695875\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">has been in the works</a> for a long time, and now finally released.

More concretely, the mission of FlexMeasures is to drastically cut down the development time on any flexibility solution, no matter if an in-built scheduler already is applicable.</p>\n<p>Together with the plugin support released in <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.io/070-professional-plugins/\">v0.7</a>, this release comes with support for people writing their own schedulers.</p>\n<p>This is relevant to researchers and startups who are innovating in the realm of algorithms, but still would like to save development time (and use FlexMeasures as a framework and web application in which to embed their logic).</p>\n<p>We will use this internally as well, as it makes any new project easier. Usually, we don't work on new schedulers in the open ― we prefer to iterate in a plugin first. If the result is great, then it'll enter FlexMeasures core.</p>\n<p>Up until now, schedulers were an internal feature, accessible by an API, but focused on storage flexibility for the main part (we worked on shiftable flexibility in other projects). Opening a core feature up for other use cases is really helpful to arrive at a better design. We've completely refactored how schedulers are implemented and how to give them the necessary information (the <code>flex-model</code> and the <code>flex-context</code>), and we're very excited how this will empower our own work and that of FlexMeasures users.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">The <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugin/customisation.html#adding-your-own-scheduling-algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">plugin developer tutorial</a> and <a href=\"https://flexmeasures.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/notation.html#describing-flexibility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this part of the API notation docs</a> tell you more.</span></p>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/505\">505</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/511\">511,</a> <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/537\">537</a>,  <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/568\">568</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/566\">566</a>.</p>\n<h2>Ingesting data on the CLI</h2>\n<p>Almost every project involves getting some historical data read in (e.g. from CSV or Excel files), be it because one uses FlexMeasures to run simulations, or to have a base data set for machine learning purposes (e.g. a forecasting algorithm). This is tough and iterative engineering work.</p>\n<p>FlexMeasures has CLI support for this (<code>flexmeasures add beliefs</code>). We tackled several issues to make this work even more developer-friendly:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>drop duplicate records with warning</li>\n<li>allow configuring which column contains explicit recording times for each data point (use case: import forecasts) </li>\n<li>localize timezone naive data</li>\n<li>support reading in datetime and timedelta values</li>\n<li>remove rows with NaN values</li>\n<li>filter by values in specific columns</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We also improved its counterpart, <code class=\"docutils literal notranslate\"><span class=\"pre\">flexmeasures</span> <span class=\"pre\">show</span> <span class=\"pre\">beliefs</span></code>. We now support:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>showing beliefs data in a custom resolution and/or timezone</li>\n<li>saving the shown beliefs data to a CSV file</li>\n<li>handle showing (and saving) instantaneous sensor data and non-instantaneous sensor data together</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This work was done in Pull Requests <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/501\">501</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/521\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">521</a>, <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/519\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">519</a> and <a href=\"http://www.github.com/SeitaBV/flexmeasures/pull/542\" target=\"null\">542</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>",
